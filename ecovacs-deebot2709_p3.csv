"2002,""We were fairly early adopters of these vacuums, but the performance was disappointing, too little suction and tool little cleaning ability.  We have not had one for years until we bought this.... This much less expensive bot is really a delight.  I am almost always surprised at the amount it picks up.  It slides easily under most furniture, and relentlessly searches out more dirt.  Very pleased at price/performance."",""Reviewed in the United States on August 4, 2019""";;;;;;;;

"2008,""I did a lot of searching, glad I came across DEEBOT N79S. I had it for about 4 months now and I run it 2-3 times a week, my floors look and stay clean of dust dirt and dog hair.  Never any issues. Once in a while DEEBOT may get stuck if a rug lifts up on the edge, but that I believe is more of the rugs fault than DEEBOT. I have mostly vinyl floors, some ceramic tile and several area rugs. DEEBOT does it all, run time is more like 2 hours or so. Another thing I like is the 2 spinning brushes rather than only 1, so both sides are taken care of as DEEBOT travels along. Definitely Recommended!"",""Reviewed in the United States on August 3, 2019""";;;;;;;;
"2009,"" This thing is great. To start off with, we have a family of 7, plus two dogs and a cat.  Most of our floors are hard. I wanted something that can pick up the fur and keep the floors clean. This does the job. It's quiet and runs for a couple of hours. The reason for four stars instead of five is a couple of reasons: Every once in a while, it loses its mind. It'll get stuck in a corner and have trouble finding its way out—even though there's a clear way out (see the video).  It'll burn its whole battery and not clean. We'll let it charge and then run it again and everything seems to work fine, then. Also, I wish it had a bigger rubber bumper on the front sensor (maybe even one above the sensor and not just below). As the Deebot edges, the sensor gets scratched. After a few months, the Deebot runs into everything instead of sensing the object. I ended up putting Gorilla Tape over the sensor. Once that gets scratched, I just replace the tape."",""Reviewed in the United States on August 3, 2019""";;;;;;;;
"2010,""Ok.  So, I've have the DBot for 2 months and had time to oberve enough for an accurate and fair review.  First and foremost,  I would like to say this is a very solid product that does a surprisingly good job I'm picking up debris off of tile and carpet.  Assembly and programming is very simple and easy, and replacement parts such as brush heads and filters are cheap and easily accessible on Amazon. This product can be programmed to vacuum only when you ask it to were set up on a schedule like I have where it vacuums every other day while I am getting ready for work.Pros:  this little guy fits directly under my couch no problem cleaning the tile floor two respectable level at a glance. The reservoir for debris within the device is easy to remove and dump as well as filter maintenance being easily accessible. Does a surprisingly good job transitioning from tile do carpet and vice versa.  Also compatible with Alexa oh, so if you do not have a schedule set up you can simply say """" Alexa, start the vacuum."""" And the way it goes. Watch for sales.  I got mine it's a deal of the day and saved over $100 off MSRP, and I feel that it's well worth it.Cons: although it works with Alexa this is not a smart device. Meaning that there is no mapping feature on this particular device and it wanders around the house aimlessly in random patterns taking it substantially longer to clean then I feel it really should. Also if there is anything left or dropped in the floor such as the towel I clean my dog's Paws with when we come in from a walk the deebot will get stuck and you'll come home to it beeping worked with a dead battery.  If you decide to stop the cycle early because it is randomly wandering around the house, again it is not a smart device and does not do very well finding its docking station. So you may have to deal with picking the thing up and putting it on the docking station or just letting it wander around at a lower power bumping into the walls and chairs until it finally figures out where home is, also providing the opportunity to get stuck.  And this is the reason for me starting to cycle while I'm still home oh, so I don't come home to a dirty floor and a a dead battery in my Robot vacuum because it's stuck on top of something.  Don't get me wrong the getting stuck thing is fairly rare and once you figure out what items will cause this issue it's fairly easy to make sure they're not around before it starts. this may be inconvenient timing but the app is already transitioned once in the last 2 months making the app I'm currently using incompatible with the device so I have to go through set up all over again."",""Reviewed in the United States on August 3, 2019""";;;;;;;;

"2050,""I have been looking at the different Robo Vacs for awhile.

Ability to connect via wifi and control through an app. Set schedules and perform different cleaning modes are a nice added bonus. I have hardwood floors but also a pretty thick rug. It does a great job navigating both. Criss crosses across the main rooms and eventually hits pretty much everything. Charge lasts a long time and I usually send it back home long before it runs out of juice.Having this I know what I would look for if I was going to upgrade and spend more for added features - I Wish the smart sensor was a bit smarter, able to map out a room to some degree and more efficiently clean the room. This model is random and does a good job avoiding things but still at times knocks in to chair legs relatively hard. Would also like to be able to set up room boarders so that you can specify if you want it to stay in a specific room. Houses with open concepts will find the thing wandering all over that level of the house.

Now the robot can easily maneuver around my small apartment, crawling up the ramps to go in an out of the rooms. My complaint is if I accidentally set a timer for automatic cleaning, which I did three times on the remote because I wanted to set the time, but instead started the automatic scheduler. NOTHING I did with the help of customer support, would erase those scheduled sessions. Taking the battery out of both the remote and the unit itself and leaving them unconnected for a day made any difference. So I had to turn it off when on the charger, then manually turn back on when I want it to clean. I find this annoying. Even turned off, this thing makes a noise at the mistakenly scheduled time. OMG, what? So I've had to send it back twice now with the same error. So now I'm waiting for the 3rd new unit to arrive. Customer service is great, but two replacements in less than 4 months is also annoying. Obviously, the company stands behind it's product by allowing the returns at their cost, but I can't clean during the down time. It cleans very well on my uneven floor surfaces, running from LR rug, to hardwood floor, to kitchen, bathroom and hallway tile, then into the BR where it encounters rugs, yoga mats and hardwood floors. Ok, this all works thanks to my rigged up system of sticky ramps , but the timer issue puts a chink in the armor. And, BTW, the yoga mats don't like the main vacuum brush, so I move them now. Deebot likes to take little bites out of the padded mats, especially a very thick one I have. If DEEBOT can fix this software error, it will be a dynamic little cleaning device. Am I the only one who has this problem?(See update above) I will update my post after I receive some items I ordered to help it move around my entire apartment. I have 3/4 to 1"""" saddles at my doorways and the robot is not always able to climb them. He gets stuck coming out of my bedroom, but it's not his fault. In the meantime, this item works way better than I expected. The dust bin gets full and I have noticed that my floors and the areas under my bed, couches and other furniture are clean for the first time (because I don't like sweeping or vacuuming much). I had a small scheduling issue with the robot, but believe that is now resolved. I bought this item from the Prime Truck. As a bonus, they gave me a gift box full of 25 baby succulents. How did they know I have a huge, indoor succulent garden? I mixed in their plants with mine and now I have an enviable set of plants like I've always wanted. The price point for the robot was very low, so I am extremely happy with this purchase."",""Reviewed in the United States on July 28, 2019""";;;;;;;;

"2094,""The N79S is one of those products that almost hits the nail on the head, but it makes you question if you should've gotten something better. I've had the DEEBOT N79S for almost 10 months, so this is a long term review. Here are the pros and cons.Pros:- Solid construction- Has decent suction and will eventually pick up most debris- Has somewhere around a 70% success rate at cleaning my apartment without getting stuck on something that it could have avoided (not counting cables or any other item that you wouldn't run over with a normal vacuum)- Has an even higher success rate at finding the charging dock- The physical remote control that comes with it is extremely handyCons:- The software (both for the robot and the app). More details in the later items on this list.- The N79S uses the infrared sensors on the front to preemptively back away from obstacles. There may be some situations where this comes in handy, but there's far more situations where the robot got stuck in a cycle of *back up -> turn right -> back up -> turn left -> repeat*. It'll eventually break out of this cycle in most cases, but i've had to manually move it sometimes .- Sometimes, it'll slightly prop itself up on a low obstacle and will try to drive forward. Forever. Those infrared sensors somehow couldn't help it here.- It struggles with small crumbs on hard surfaces. The two sweepers slap a lot of the crumbs away from the robot, so it needs to do a few passes to clean hard surfaces.- I've had issues connecting with their iPhone app, but I honestly didn't try too hard to figure out what was going on after it failed to connect twice. No issues with the Android app. I use the physical remote most of the time.Honestly, I can't complain too much about the N79S. It's cheap, and it gets the job done without too much supervision. However, there's some frustrating scenarios that constantly crop up. This will be good for you if you're not actively trying to push the robot to its limits, and if you can accept the fact that this isn't the perfect solution if you're looking for something to clean up while you're at work. You're going to have to give this guy a little shove every now and then, especially if you have any cables laying on the floor.For reference so that you can adjust based on your own layout - I'm in an open floorplan 1100 sqft apartment. 2 rooms are short pile carpet, bathrooms are tile, and kitchen + living room are hardwood."",""Reviewed in the United States on July 25, 2019""";;;;;;;;

"2140,"" 2nd Update: Only five months in and the thing no longer works. The roller brush no longer spins. I took it out and put it back in and it still didn’t work. Without the spinning brush the vacuum doesn’t pick stuff up anymore. And the oddest part is that the thing randomly turns itself on. This morning I found it dead in the bathroom.1st Update: when this thing is working, it works.  We noticed that only after a short time of using it that suction started to suffer. It did so great in the beginning I had a hard time believing the vacuum started to fail already so I decided to replace the brushes because ours were looking warped.  We have 4 animals and I have long hair and all of the brushes were wrapped up in all that hair. Replacing the brushes did the trick. It’s back to being awesome!Original review:  Sunday My husband and I swept, vacuumed and mopped. Tuesday, we ran this brand new robot vacuum we got on prime day. The pic shows all the crap it picked up, after one session of cleaning. It moves easily between our area rugs, tile and hardwood floors. We have three cats and one dog and lots of hair. This picks it all up and in one vacuuming session it’s full. We have four litter boxes and the thing I love about this the most is that it keeps the area around the litter boxes free of litter. It’s been a great addition, especially since we’re not great housekeepers.Needless to say, this little robot is awesome. I highly recommend you get one!"",""Reviewed in the United States on July 21, 2019""";;;;;;;;
"2141,""This little floor cleaner works well on our hardwood floors. The random cleaning mode makes for a lot of wasted battery time, and it will get caught under things that are about the same height off the floor as this cleaner is high. But most of our pet hair ends up near the walls, so the edge cleaning mode works great. Doesn't do well with throw rugs. Battery life isn't great, but adequate for 1-2 rooms. Not too loud. If you just need an inexpensive basic floor cleaner, this is not a bad choice."",""Reviewed in the United States on July 21, 2019""";;;;;;;;

Vacuum is avoiding 60% of objects so it’s not bad and won’t fall from stairs. It’s good for one room not a whole 1 level house.

Sometimes he rolls over a cat toy and panics because the main brush is now clogged with said toy. Sometimes he gets caught in the SAME spot by the fire place where there’s an annoying change in elevation.

"2210,""[edited]After a month of usage, I found Deebot works pretty well in my home on both carpet and wood floor.Pros:The vacuum power is pretty good, I found you can adjust the vacuum power on the app.The main brushes are high quality. One of my experience with previous generation of roomba was the plastic/rubber brush that ends up not being able to pickup small debris and prone to failure when long hairs tangle on them. Deebot's brush does a better job with (seems like) synthetic materials and dense fibers.Integration with Alexa and app is pretty good. The app can show the life cycle of consumable parts.Cost effective: good performance with the price point.Cons:Occasional docking problems. I guess there might be a firmware update but the docking problem has significantly reduced in the past month.It doesn't build a house map so still use what I call a Monte Carlo Cleansing process. Which is great to me since I don't want my floor map to be in another company's cloud. However it might be not as efficient. But provided that similar products might cause 5 times, I think it is a good tradeoff.// originalI mean it cleans pretty well, but it doesn't DOCK! OMG it is so painful to watch it docking...

"2214,""I work outside a lot, so I get a bunch of dirt on my tile floors. It’s so great to come home and see the vacuum lines. I let it run while I’m gone, so I’m not sure if it gets stuck on my rugs or if it just runs out of battery. I don’t know that it’s ever made it back to the charging station itself. It never claimed to do well on thick carpets or rugs, so I’m not too mad about that. I had a Roomba before, and it would call out when it was stuck for long periods of time, but this one doesn’t do that. I usually have to go searching for it when I get home. Either way, it definitely beats vacuuming by hand. The couple of times I have been home and watched it, it doesn’t hit the items most of the time to make it turn around. That helps keep the scuffs off of my furniture!"",""Reviewed in the United States on July 15, 2019""";;;;;;;;

"2218,""First off, I love this thing. I have hard surface floors on the whole bottom of my house and with having a dog and a cat it picks up the dog and cat hair wonderfully. But let me just say that the suction power works so well that when my newly adopted dog decided to poop on the floor while I was in the shower one morning and the deebot went off at 6:15 am like it normally does, it not only sucked up some of the (wet) poop, but it also decided to leave a nice trail of poo for me to have to clean up when I got out of the shower. (Go ahead and laugh HA!) So after that happening, I decided to contact ECOVACS to try to find out the best way to clean the interior of the machine out. They responded to my email within minutes on a Friday night around 10 pm and they asked for my proof of purchase to see if it still fell under the warranty. Once I did that, they responded back the next day telling me that since it is under warranty they were going to send me a brand new machine! I never in a million years expected that and of course I was thrilled that either myself or my boyfriend would have to clean out a poopy machine. So in my eyes that is top notch service from this company and I would highly recommend this machine!"",""Reviewed in the United States on July 15, 2019""";;;;;;;;
"2219,""We first purchased this robot vacuum a little over a year ago. It was our first jump into robot vacuums. We purchased it because it was steeply on sale and had generally favorable reviews. Right out of the box, it was easy to use and worked well enough. Sure, being a lower-grade robot vacuum, it didn't have the BEST pathing hardware/software, but it did a good enough job. However, we had problems after less than six months of light usage(maybe every-other-day). There was a substantial clicking sound in one of the rotating brushes. We worked with Ecovacs who took GREAT care of us, but it was ultimately decided that it could not be fixed and they would send us a replacement. However, the second one has had more problems than the first (again, only having owned it for less than six months with semi-daily use). This second vacuum, despite being the same model, has a slightly higher profile than the first and gets stuck on things (e.g. the edge of the couch) far more often than the original. Plus, the front bumpers have now become defective and get easily stuck in the 'bumped' position, meaning that it routinely thinks it is running into things, leading to it rotating for about 20 seconds then shutting down and beeping. This happens so frequently that it's hard to use it as it is more than likely going to shut down within minutes.It's difficult to give this vacuum a good rating. It's definitely what you pay for - a very low-grade robot vacuum. Kudos to Ecovac for great customer service, though. I'd just recommend spending a little more money on a higher grade robot vacuum, even potentially from Ecovacs (although we will still be looking). A bit more money will get you a vacuum with substantially better pathing and hopefully fewer functional issues."",""Reviewed in the United States on July 15, 2019""";;;;;;;;

I purchased in Feb.2019, used it every day for about 30 mins a day up until about a month ago, when it stopped working.  Worked very well, only negative thing I saw was that sometimes it had a hard time finding its """"home"""".  I could not believe the amount of pet hair and dirt this thing picks up.  Sadly, for some reason, it stopped working a month ago.  At first we thought it was not charging.  Or maybe it had something stuck on the rollers.  After troubleshooting it ourselves, we ended up calling the support number that was listed.  After troubleshooting with them over the phone, they decided to send us a complete replacement which made us happy.  Very good customer service.

"2223,""I liked that it grabbed everything well, but I didn’t like how often I had to go rescue it from a bathroom rug or under the bed. We have two shedding dogs and as long as it has a clear path to the hair it will grab it and usually not just blow it away. So a little prep of pulling out all the dining room chairs, moving the trash can, etc. is in order for it to get everywhere you need.  Also, with longer human hair it really got tangled up fast and needed emptying and cleaning/yanking for it to do a good job and not screech at you loudly as it works.

"2226,""I really love having one of those at home, and for the price it’s definitely worth it. It cleans, it’s not excessively loud, and deals with obstacles fairly well.Overall, the vacuum could easily get 5 stars if not for the bugs.  Specifically, 2 things bother me:1. It doesn’t really understand the “return to base” command.  I mean, it takes a good 5 minutes for it to actually make it back to the base after you’ve given the command. I’m hoping that will get better with time as the vacuum understands my house layout better - but so far no signs of that...2. Whenever there’s a power outage (which happens often at my place), the robot just starts cleaning for no apparent reason. Last time there was a short outage due to a storm, and I wouldn’t have known except that I was woken up at 4am by the Deebot doing the rounds... <U+0001F605>"",""Reviewed in the United States on July 15, 2019""";;;;;;;;

"2289,""I have two irobots. Comparing this to them, this is much quieter, does not get stuck on my carpet like the roomba does. The bin is bigger. And for the price, it can’t be beat.  It has more sensors than the roomba. It doesn’t hit the wall very often.  There’s a remote that you can put on the table or you can use the remote on your phone.

"2290,""In general, this compares favorably with my Roomba. It is quieter, runs much longer, seems smarter about finding its way home, can follow a wall closely without touching it, and it is easier to clean.Update: If the company were to fix the problem mentioned below, plus do something about the excessively long beeping when it has an error, I would probably buy another one.It has a significant design flaw. When it get stuck on something, such as our fireplace hearth, it doesn't turn off. It will keep grinding its wheels on the carpet for literally hours";" digging a deeper and messy mark into the carpet. It is pretty bad that the design of this didn't account for the obvious error condition that no sensor of any kind had been triggered within the past few minutes. The same problem also occurs with table legs that curve as they meet the floor.Update: This device also suffers from the same design flaw of the early Roomba's. If your attempts to clean it do not allow it to perform smoothly -- it keeps stopping and complaining, you may need to do some minor disassembly of the brush's roller bearing. This is the non-driven end. If it does not rotate very easily, it needs interior cleaning. It has 3 parts: a metal spindle and two plastic parts. All parts are pushed together. The plastic parts have 3 tiny bumps that keep them in place. You will need to separate all three parts, starting with the spindle. Inside you will find hair and similar stacked up inside the plastic nut part of the assembly. Remove dirt, reassemble, good for another few months.Overall, despite the flaws mentioned above, I find this to be a good machine at a reasonable price point."",""Reviewed in the United States on July 9, 2019""";;;;;;;

My Deebot had performed flawlessly for 12 months and then, oooh it would start as programmed, but shortly after it signaled (2 beeps) that there was a, """"main brush malfunction"""".  I placed a call to support which was quickly answers by a human and after a few troubleshooting steps the support tech asked for some information regarding my purchase, i.e., date of purchase and order number (both available from Amazon).

Upon receipt by Ecovac, they quickly turned around and sent me a replacement, providing me with all the relevant shipping/tracking information.  I received my replacement 12 days from the date I shipped my malfunctioning unit back to Ecovac. Using their enclosed instructions I was able to again, quickly interface it with my home network, activate it on my iPhone and link it to my Amazon Echo.

"2305,""I purchased Sep 2018.  I'm at almost a year in but it's acting flaky.To start, I think like others have stated, it's a sweeper, not really a vacuum.  Yeah it gets stuff off the carpet too, it just isn't that efficient.  The spinning brushes on the front whisk stuff away just as much as they do bring debris in to be vacuumed up.  It's also super dumb.  It's unusual that it will be back in the charging cradle by the end of the run on it's own without me having to get up and get it unstuck or some other error.This one time it was under a 4 leg chair.  It was like 75% out, when it hit the bumper and it turned 180 and went right back under the chair.  There's also a corner in the house it always gets stuck, just because it's too dumb to find it's way out.  And it will completely get stuck on things like a cat scratcher base that isn't high enough for the bumper to hit.ANYWAY, as of now, almost a year, something is completely wrong with it.  The sensor doesn't work anymore so it just runs around and smashes into walls, chairs, etc.  It was also trying to start at midnight, despite not having a schedule then.  Support gave me a reset option, but that only half helped.The best I can say is that it helps keep things on the floor from sticking to my feet, but that's about it.

In Arizona the dust is extremely fine like face powder, and the robovac is really great picking up the dust and hair from two cats. It's unbelievable how much cat accommodates in a couple of days!  Be sure to use Auto mode to avoid the wall bumping and damage to the lens. It's a well made product and would not hesitate to by another DEEBOT vacumm. Overall a good robovac for the money. It's design flaw is it's IR sensors that help it from bumping walls. I am like one of many others that have had this issue. For some reason the sensors fail to detect walls regardless of the wall's color/light within a couple weeks to a month of use.  Customer support was very good once I got acceptance of the problem. However, I don't know if the replacement will last any longer. If yours starts bumping into walls after being used it for a relatively short time, turn in a warranty claim.Got my replacement and realized that the device doesn't use the IR sensors when used in Single Room mode. It just bumps around the room, of course, scratching up the plastic IR lens and therefore will interfere with the IR system used in Auto mode.

"2396,""I’ve had this Deebot for 10 months now and I can say it’s a 3/4 star product.First off, my deebot will not program. Even when I called ecovacs and the guy went step by step with me several times to program it, it wouldn’t program. At first I was annoyed by this but now I don’t care.The side bristles have lasted 10 months of vacuuming 4-5 times a week. The main brush is still perfectly fine so I’d say the quality is pretty good for those. I have mainly hardwood and very low-pile area rugs that it runs on. I have no pets. It will get stuck on my carpet and my thicker rug so I have to close the door to the carpeted closet and I have to flip up the rug ends so the deebot won’t climb up. It’s a little cumbersome but the deebot is $139.... it’s no $500 iRobot.  So I expect as much.It cleans randomly.... there’s no way it remembers where it’s cleaned or anything like that. Our robot is an idiot and sometimes I have to guide it to a new area of the house because I’ve noticed its done the same movements in the same area for like 20 minutes.It seems to throw around little crumbs or dead grass pieces or just really light junk. It can’t quite suck those up all the time so it’s annoying that I have to stand there with the controller to make sure it gets the crumbs or basically I vacuum or sweep the crumbs before I run the deebot which seems to kind of defeat the purpose of the deebot. I don’t know.All in all I like our robot because it does light weekly maintenance and it’s nice that my floors never get too dusty or nasty but I also thoroughly clean at least once a month even with the robot. I do wish it was a little better though but I guess if I wanted a smarter and better vacuum I just have to pay more money for better features. All in all our vacuum is kind of an idiot, mostly does it’s job and sometimes needs its hand held, but it’s still loved.

It still got stuck at places that I thought I'd have no trouble getting out of, such as slating table leg, but overall it was a trusty  machine that made me consider upgrading to higher end Deebot models.But after about a year it stopped working. It has low battery warning with red light and 4 beeping sound when the battery is fully charged, which makes me suspect that the rechargeable battery has died. Roomba which n79 replaced still works with the original battery after 7 years albeit shorter time, so one year of battery usage is quite disconcerting.

"2461,""We bought one of these about 3 months ago and loved it so much that we bought another for our best friend’s house where we stay a lot. We all think it’s a life changer. That may seem like hyperbole but I assure you that when you realize that you will never have to vacuum again, you will be amazed. No, it cannot do stairs but it does such a great job on tile, wood-type floors and carpet that your old vacuum will end up with as much dust on it as in it. At first we thought that it couldn’t possibly be as good on carpet as our Dyson, and if you actually vacuum by hand every day then that could be true. But if you’re like us, using the robot every day far exceeds the frequency of doing it manually. Our carpets have never looked or felt better. We no longer have kids or pets and we don’t wear shoes in the house so your needs may be different, but I cannot imagine what features this machine lacks that I would ever need. It marches around the house, sometimes purposefully and sometimes randomly, but really gets the job done. If it misses something or you want to send it to a problem area there’s the remote control to do that. The remote also has several programs including automatically going out at a preset time of day. It can also be controlled by a phone app. The litter box is plenty big and easy to clean. The batteries seem to last at least an hour and a half with mixed floor types although we really just send it out and do something else. It can get snagged on extension cords, drapes, loose area rugs etc. It’s pretty easy to eliminate these problem areas and if it gets stuck it will beep to let you know and if you’re not home it will just shut off and wait for you. If you put its home base in an area that’s not too tricky it will almost always make it home by itself. Ours sleeps under a dresser. This machine needs about 3.5” of clearance to get underneath something which means that it will clean under many beds, dressers and sofas. We will NEVER be without one of these type of machines for the rest of our lives and I would buy this unit yet again."",""Reviewed in the United States on June 26, 2019""";;;;;;;;

"2463,""The vacuum works fairly well, but you'll find yourself spending more time cleaning its dust container and brushes than the time it will take you to manually vacuum with your good-old older big vacuum.

"2467,""We have had it for about one month and it was as much as my wife and I learning what to do as it was the vacuum learning.  This robot vacuum seems to be learning and gets better with time. Clearance is a big deal, it will jam itself under a table or cabinet with low clearance and this is common as I have found out from others I know with robo vacuums. There are solutions for this and I cut 2x2 wooden posts and put them under the kitchen cabinets to keep the robot back and put 10 lb. lifting plates in places that are hard to see and keep the vacuum from getting under things.  These were much cheaper options than buying the """"smart"""" fences to keep these robot vacuums away from things.I called customer service after we had the unit a month or so because I would come home and find it stopped somewhere.  I thought it was the battery.  Customer service had me start the vacuum, they listened to the number of beeps and told what was wrong.  There was something interfering with the better bar.  Customer service instructed me how to check it and it had picked up a twist tie and it got lodged in the beater bar.  Once I removed it the vacuum worked like a charm again.  Great customer service.  I have also ordered original replacement parts for the vacuum that are much better than the generic ones sold on-line."",""Reviewed in the United States on June 26, 2019""";;;;;;;;

"2469,""We bought the deebot about a year ago and were surprised how well the little guy worked. We have a small apartment (670 sq ft), so many of the issues claimed by others wasn't a big deal for us. We used it, on average, once a week. While it did pick up surprisingly well, we had to constantly save it from traps it found via cords and corners and sometimes just simple transitions from carpet to hardwood (which is what we mostly have). While far from a smart tool, we were happy with it. Till it just stopped. Completely. We checked the charging base, we checked the vacuum itself, everything we could think of. There were no discernible problems, it simply wouldn't accept a charge or do anything but beep any longer.  Again, this is after only about a year of fairly light usage. For the price and what it claims to do, it's just not worth it. We were sold on the idea. The technology and quality of this product didn't match up.

"2474,""We ordered the DEEBOT N79S about 2 months ago and couldn't be happier with it. Even though it doesn't map out your room it will still cover about 90 - 95% of the area in a single run by randomly bouncing around. We have an extended area that covers out Dining Room and Living Room that is about 250 - 300 square feet that it cleans in one run. We have a large long haired Collie/Golden Retrieve mix that sheds like crazy and it has no problems getting all of the hair up. We clean out the tray and the brush after every use but that only takes a minute at the most. The brush wheel is easily removed to be cleaned if you want to remove every hair off of it. We also use this on our tile floors and it has no problems getting up most of the dirt. I honestly don't think that we have gotten out our vacuum for our rugs since we have purchased this item.  We have moved the DEEBOT to every room in the house and it works perfectly no matter if it is a heavy rug, thin rug or tile floor.  The only draw back we have seen is that it does get stuck under our china cabinet even though it is very close to the floor. So we have put a could of cardboard boxes underneath the cabinet to keep it from getting stuck. We were able to catch the DEEBOT on special for $150 and it was money well spent.

Keeps kids entertained, our toddler cheers it on and they all take turns naming it and helping tidy up when it’s running. One or two dogs is a husky with lots of shedding undercoat fur, and this thing makes fur management a snap. We run it 3-4 times per week, and it gets loads of dirt, dust and pet hair each time. It runs over an hour on our hardwood and tile, puts itself to home base when it gets low battery or too full. It does fine on rugs heavy enough to hold themselves in place, but does push smaller lighter weight rugs around. It does okay on thicker carpet just seems to use battery faster than other floor types. The suction is strong enough for all duty we have used it for, and it will tangle like any vacuum on tasseled rugs or thinner fabric items laying around. I haven’t replaced the filter or brushes yet but it looks like they might need more frequent change outs with as heavy use as we have.

There is no way to calibrate the sensors to prevent it from getting stuck underneath the same 4 things, every single day.The other problem I have, is, when it finally does get stuck, it beeps loudly several times, then fully discharges its battery. Why is this a thing? So if it gets stuck, 10 minutes into a cleaning cycle, it'll fully discharge, forcing me to recharge it for several hours before I can start it again. This is a MASSIVE design flaw. It should have some kind of standby mode, sleep mode something.

Remote can also be set for specific times for the bot to run.Cons: app to sync with phone is useless because it does not sync.When in operation, the rotating brushes creates a bit of a fan which can cause the hair bunnies to blow away from the unit.Even though it makes less than a regular vacuum, it’s still a bit loud.Sometimes it has trouble finding its home once it’s done running its cycle and you have to help guide it home."",""Reviewed in the United States on June 22, 2019""";;;;;;;;

"2541,""I pretty much never write reviews but I just HAD to say this thing is AMAZING!  It truly is the best purchase I've ever made.  I got it on sale as a deal of the day - I paid $174 and got a 3gen Echo Dot with it.  Worth every penny!  Are there more expensive models that do a better job?  Sure.  But for a first time robot vacuum purchase, this thing is great.  Does it clean in a random pattern?  Yes. Does it miss a spot once in a while?  Sure.  But if you run it enough it gets virtually every square inch of your floors that isn't a tiny nook in a corner.  It goes under all my couches and along the baseboards in my kitchen.I have very old wood floors in a rental (so I can't have them resealed myself) and sweeping them basically just pushes dirt around.  No more!  The first several times I ran this thing it picked up a terrifying amount of dirt.  The best thing is it picks up all the tiny particles of dirt that sweeping NEVER did.  I love being able to walk around barefoot again without feeling nasty floor dirt on my feet.  I cannot speak to how it works on carpet as I don't have any - but I would imagine this works best for wood/tile floors.Make sure you follow the directions for cleaning DEE BOT so you get the longest life out of it as possible.  Dump the container after every use.  Clean the outer filter 2x/week at least, and the inner filter 1x/week.  Clean the hair out of the brushes on the bottom as needed.  Sometimes it will eat things that make it freak out, just remove them from the brushes.I use my Echo Dots (I have several) to tell it to go clean and tell it to go home and charge, which is awesome.  Sometimes I use the remote to direct it to clean up specific messes - which is WAY easier to do, siting on the couch watching TV, than getting the broom/dust pan out and sweeping.  I use this the most for cat litter, which is picks up excellently.  I have the app but don't use it much, I don't find it necessary with Alexa/the remote.  You can set it on a cleaning schedule, but, I like to put all our chairs up before it runs, and I have to pick up all the cat toys.  If it encounters a cat toy it usually tries to eat it and gets stuck, but it doesn't ruin it or anything, just have to pull it out.  It gets stuck on the curtains sometimes, and it kind of slid over a 5"""" threshold into my office and cried for help.  You do have to rescue it sometimes, but it's so, so, so worth it.  Also, it will just shut off if it gets stuck on something and you don't respond to it's cries for help.  Our power went out in the middle of the night once and when it came back on it somehow activated DEE BOT.  I came down to a bunch of stuff pulled off my coffee table and was like.....this is really odd.  I found DEE BOT under my TV console tangled in a bunch of wires.  It didn't hurt anything and I was able to easily untangle it.  I'm going to get some wood cut at Lowes and put it under the TV area so DEE BOT can't reach the cords anymore - right now I'm using a mop to block the area.While this is a cheaper robot vacuum it is much better than a cheap one my friend bought.  Hers races around her house crashing into walls - this one DOES NOT.  It is very gentle and lightly bumps into things sometimes before turning.  We have two light-weight bikes in our living room and it glides around them easily without knocking them over.Bonus: I have HORRIBLE allergies I take antihistamines for daily.  I have a cat and I'm allergic to my cat.  It picks up ALL dust/cat hair with ease and has dramatically improved my allergies.  Why are you still reading this obscenely long review??

I have a couch that the robot some times gets under but is unable to get out of. Once it gets stuck, it starts beeping and you need to rescue it. I try to block of the entrance so it doesn't get under my couch. Does a fair job of finding the base station when its out of charge although it's not always successful finding it. Alexa integration works well. We let the robot clean every day even if the house looks clean - its interesting how the dust container fills up with dust that i cant really see on the floors.

I set him to auto and he goes for about an hour and a half before he takes himself back to the dock. He has full reign of my first floor and he’s only been seriously stuck once.

Cleans great, doesn't get hung up on rug edges or under furniture or tangled in cords or just stop for no reason like the others, and I am really impressed with the ease of cleaning. Brush pops right out to remove hair or whatever and there are no small parts to worry about losing. Quick and simple to empty bin and you can wash everything in the sink in a minute or 2. I have hardwood floors and carpet and a golden retriever, so this little thing gets a workout and continues to impress. I put googly eyes on mine and a little hat and named him General ScootButt.

I named mine Dobie, and he vacuums my apartment twice a week.  The first few times I used my bot, I was stunned at how much dust and dirt it collected from under large furniture items and under my bed.  My place has all hardwood floors, but I do have to pick up the few throw rugs I use in the bathroom and bedroom (or he tries to eat them).  All in all, a wonderful purchase.Update--Jan 2020. My Deebot is still working well. Only change is that it returns to charging base after running an hour. It used to vacuum for 90 minutes. Since it is over 2 and a half years old, that seems reasonable. If/when mine dies, I definitely intend to get another one, same brand and model. As for people who get freaked out trying to connect the unit to wifi, or running it while not at home, that is your fault. Don't expect this unit to perform any differently than a manual upright vac.

After cleaning it and doing everything recommended, the unit still did not work so I bought a replacement kit, changed the brush and still nothing. This was just the begging of the must tedious process up to date!Multiple people get involved (over 4 at this point) in the same line of communication so no true follow up exist.

When it’s confirmed that the product had a malfunction and still under warranty they said, in a not so friendly tone, that if I did not ship the defected unit they will not send the replacement. Since I’m out of the country and they did not provide a prepaid international shipping guide (only ground), I’m not able to send it right away.

I have twin toddlers and a dog who emits joy fluffs on a constant basis. After reading a few reviews on Amazon, one in particular ended up being our experience as well. We got one Deebot, we didn't pick up the area rugs and turned him on. We were amazed at how much he picked up, since we had swept just the day before. He easily avoided the stairs, he cleaned our area rugs, we have one low pile and the other a little longer. Our children are in love with it as well. They love watching him and try to decide where he's going to go. It also prompts them to pick up their toys, because they don't want Deebot to eat it. After three days we bought a 2nd one for our upstairs. We do have a thick rug in our children's room which my Shark has a problem with. Deebot did go over it, but when he tried to edge around it he got stuck. This was more than what I thought he was going to do and we easily pick it up for him. He goes under most of our furniture, we did have one couch that was low, which we got longer legs for, so we don't have to move it around for him to get under it. We love our Deebots and he does a great job cleaning up after our toddler's messes and the dog joy fluffs.

I have owned this for over six months now and can say it does a great job of picking up the dirt, hair and dog fur (short haired dog).  This product was designed to work on the surfaces I have and the description was very clear that it will not work on other surfaces besides those described.  It works just as expected.  It does a great job of picking up the huge majority of everything we usually have on the floor.  While not a replacement for regular vacuuming and mopping, it sure cuts down on the mess.  It does a good job at getting into tight areas that aren't usually cleaned with a regular mop or vacuum.  The family loves watching it go around.  The dog is a little concerned with it invading her house, but keeps her distance.  It is easy to maintain and clean.  Only a couple of quirks encountered so far.  One is replacement brushes by the company on Amazon, don't seem to be the same size as the originals.  Two, when the power goes out the robot, if left on auto, will leave its docking station and start searching for it until the power comes back on.  That has lead us to searching the house for the robot when we returned home at the end of the day when the power had apparently been out for several hours.  Just seems odd that it needs the base station to be powered on all the time after it is docked.  Don't let those two minor things keep you from buying this robot.

Honestly, it has been one of the best things I have ever bought her! She loves it! She can set a schedule for it to run, she can launch it from her phone wherever she is and it just runs. We have my wife and two daughters with long hair and two dogs (1 sheds, 1 doesn't) and hardwood floors throughout. This thing does a good enough job that my wife has gone from vacuuming the floors every other day to maybe once a week! The only drawback is that the hair accumulates in the rolling wheel that causes an error. It also gathers on the spinning brush that causes an error. It also gets in the bumper and disrupts the sensor that causes an error. It's not that bad though...15-20 minutes cleaning the hair from the vacuum and it's back to work, error free. It detects the drop off to the back room without issue. It detects the large objects (fridge, cabinets, etc.) with no problem. It doesn't detect dining room chair legs very well and gently bumps into them but does not leave a mark or any dings. My wife and I are very surprised at just how well this little unit works!

"2733,""I've had some experience with robotic vacuums from bigger name brands in the past.  They mostly worked fine for a while, and before too long had components start to fail and batteries that wouldn't hold charge.  I've only had this vacuum for a few months now, but I'm blown away by it.  We only use it in our kitchen with linoleum floors, but its probably 250+ sq ft with a challenging geometry.Runtime:Battery life has been great.  We've seen 2+ hours on hard flooring.  I've tried timing the total runtime, but it's been so long that I've gotten bored and moved on to other things before it finished every time.Cleaning ability:The DEEBOT does a great job of removing everything from the floor.  We only run it about once a week, so the dust bin needs to be emptied after an hour or so of cleaning.  Having a larger dust bin would be nice, but it really does pack the dirt in there making an efficient use of the small space.Features:+Quiet operation.  Not nearly as loud as the previous robovac we had.  We can easily watch TV or listen to the radio in the next room.+Ease of use.  Press one button on the remote to clean.  Two buttons to return to home.-App support.  I haven't tried using the app as it requires permissions that I am not comfortable sharing for a Chinese made vacuum.  I'm not someone who is overly concerned about privacy, but I don't understand why a vacuum would be requesting the permissions it does.  Cannot comment on app functionality-The remote scheduling only allows setting one time, and it occurs every day.  It would be nice to be able say """"vacuum every tuesday"""", but that is not possible without app support-Same goes for different cleaning modes.  The DEEBOT has an edge clean mode which will circumnavigate the the edges of the room making sure to deep clean areas that collect dust.  It is not possible to schedule edge clean mode with the remote.The positives far outweigh the negatives, and I highly recommend this vacuum to anyone thinking about jumping into the robovac arena.  We use one in the kitchen now, and when we finally install hard flooring in our sunroom we will definitely be getting a second one.  I wish I felt comfortable using the app so I could operate it through Alexa, but that really is a minor concern.

"2757,""First let me say that I love having a robot vacuum. It’s my first and I selected it based on reviews outside of Amazon.  BUT I’ve never been able to make it work with WiFi, despite long sessions trying every recommended strategy.  I think I’m ok with going over and pushing a button to make it go, however.  If we leave the power on and it’s on the charger, it decides to clean at random hours (usually in the middle of the night).  We’ve turned it off to clear any accidental presets and we’ve unplugged it, all per instructions.  But it insists on these middle of the night missions, waking up people and the dog.  So now we switch off the power after each use, requiring two buttons to push.  That’s not too tough, but I’ll probably buy a different brand next time."",""Reviewed in the United States on June 2, 2019""";;;;;;;;

"2766,""I've had this thing for a while now, and with proper bristle maintenance this robot does a fantastic job at keeping my tile floors clean. Even gets over small lips in door frames to get into different rooms. If the area you want it to clean is massive, it's probably going to miss spots. Ensure you pick up all loose wires and small objects on the floor, or it could get stuck. The way I think it works is it cleans in all directions it can until its battery runs low. In my small apartment, it cleans everything for 2-3 hours in a half aimless, half articulated routine. I set it to go when I'm at work, and come home to a very clean floor. It's cleaner than I could ever have made it with a broom, I lack the patience to sweep for 3 hours straight. I have no pets or kids, though. This robot does not like wet floors, but it'll still clean them. It's not that loud for a robot, but it's not quieter than a running sink.

"2830,""I. Hate. Cleaning. Anything that lessens my time spent sweeping, mopping, vacuuming or dusting is worth its weight in gold to me. I have a messy boyfriend, messy kid and a hairy fur-and-kibble-dropping dog, so before I bought this robot, I was constantly frustrated at how dirty my floors were, even immediately after I swept. I hated cleaning because - well, let's be honest here! - I seriously resented how my family would just waltz right on in, oblivious that I had just mopped or swept, with their muddy dirty shoes, or leave the door open for leaves and crap to blow in, or ignore the dog slobber drips and kibble crumbs and walk right through it instead of cleaning it up. While this vacuum can't really fix the wet messes - dog slobber, drips of soda, juice, wet sticky mystery substances, spaghetti sauce (ughhhh) - it handles just about everything else. (Maybe my next search should be to see if Ecovacs makes a mop-bot yet!)I bought this in July 2018, and have now had it almost a year. I purchased right before my floors were upgraded from bare, unsealed concrete (yes we really lived on that floor for years and it was awful) to wood-grain laminate. At first I was concerned that this might not pick tiny dust and dirt up from the concrete floor - but it did really well. Then, I was worried that the plastic sweeping brushes might cause static build-up and maybe wouldn't pick the fine dog hair up off the laminate flooring - but it surprised me. There doesn't seem to be any problem with static, even almost a year in.I have given this poor machine ZERO maintenance other than emptying the collection bin and occasionally pulling off the brushes and removing long strands of hair (mine) that have collected around the base. I have not even replaced the filters - I just take them outside once in awhile and give them a tap against a brick to knock some of the built-up dirt off. I wouldn't recommend this approach (you should definitely give it a little more care/maintenance than I have), but I am impressed with how well it has held up with zero effort. This poor robot has been kicked, pushed, and bumped many times and still continues to do its job with the same efficiency as always.It picks up my boyfriend's gross, coarse, long beard hairs (I cringe whenever I see them because they remind me of a different kind of body hair that, thankfully, he doesn't actually shed! LOL). It picks up the dog's short, straight hairs that usually stick to the floor with static electricity, as well as her fine undercoat that is now shedding after winter. It even picks up the inevitable hoardes of tiny little black ants that come inside in the Spring thru every crack and crevice searching for crumbs (even when there are none!)... and although I'm sure many of them just crawl out when the vacuum goes to dock for charging, I like to think that they die a dusty, slow death. I do seem to see fewer of them along my floors and baseboards after using this robot. It may just temporarily disrupt their little paths, but either way - death to house ants!Pros:- Inexpensive, compared to name brands like Roomba- Good quality for the price- Durable"; has held up well with little to no maintenance- Convenient- Reduces my annoyance w my messy family!- As long as you run it regularly, it does a good job (not intended for heavily soiled areas)Cons:- Collection bin/tray is pretty small;" must empty after each use (hope this company will eventually make one with the auto-empty bin like Roomba introduced last year!)- Kind of loud - definitely nowhere near as loud as a traditional vacuum, but still loud enough to annoy me when I'm watching TV or napping (so I tend to turn it on as I'm leaving the house - so I don't have to listen to it at all!)- Sometimes gets stuck under a certain piece of furniture that's just tall enough for the front bumper to get under, but not tall enough for it to move around (I could probably fix this by setting up a barrier but it doesn't happen that often)"",""Reviewed in the United States on May 24, 2019""";;;;;;

It takes way longer then just vacuuming and sweeping myself but I don’t care. I wake up to a clean floor I didn’t vacuum. Only negative which isn’t even a real negative is it doesn’t like wet food...aka tiny cut up soft fruits and veggies my baby throws on the floor.  I made the mistake like 10 times before learning to just not be lazy and wipe those up myself. It’s nice because I went from sweeping/vacuuming everyday to just vacuuming what I now call a deep clean where I get my corners and baseboards like every other month. Which when you have babies and toddlers that extra 20 minutes of vacuuming is enough to push you over the edge to tears. I can’t recommend this thing enough. As a side note it’s not a silent vacuum.

"2883,""March 2020 update. Well, I've given up. It's now just a $160 doorstop. It worked great for 6 months. Back in December I contacted customer support. Two of the three people who replied were obviously just giving me their rehearsed response. One actually responded to my issues. They had me do a reset which consists of holding the start button until it beeps 3 times, release that button, turn it off and on, then run as usual. It seemed to help after doing this many times. I think I had a week where it ran normally. Now that resent does not help at all and it is not picking up very well either. Since I gave up on it I let my husband take it apart. There were no clogs anywhere and nothing that looked like it could be repaired. So, lesson learned. I'm saving up for a Roomba.Dec. 2019 update. For the last month or so my beloved Dee has been stopping for no apparent reason. I keep this VERY clean. I empty the bin and clean the filters daily. I purchased extra filters so I can change them out and wash them. I also remove any fibers or hair that become entangled around the brushes. For the first 15-20 minuets it stops and beeps like it is caught on something, but it's not. After that it runs fine. I have to say I am very disappointed. It ran so well for the first 6 months.I have been using my Deebot for a few weeks now and I could not be happier! I read many reviews before purchasing and I believe I had realistic expectations of what this little machine could and could not do. This is the low end of the robot vacuum spectrum. It does not do room mapping. I think some of the negative reviews expected too much and should have bought a more sophisticated machine. I just wanted something to vacuum my hard floors all on 1 level, no stairs.I was a little bit concerned that my very dark floors would be a problem. But Dee has done well. My area rugs are also dark so it does not see a contrast there. Sometimes it gets on to the area rugs and sometimes it does not. But that's okay with me. I just want the dust and cat hair that float around the floors gone and it does a fantastic job. I do the rugs with a more powerful vacuum. About once a week I get into the areas that Dee can not. That was my plan. But now that Dee is sucking up all that dust and cat hair every day there is much less in the areas that are blocked off from it. As a bonus it gets under my china cabinet. I've been battling some very persistent spicers for years and Dee has been victorious! He gets the crumbs under the toe kick area of my kitchen cabinets, another constant battle. He also fits under my sofa and loveseat. My other vacuums do not. I had to move the furniture to get under those. If I want him to get under my curtains I tuck them up under the blinds that day. If not he cleans around them. Yes he bumps into things. This is how he finds his way around. He is suppose to do that. He has not damaged anything, even my newly painted white baseboards. His bumper works well. Often as he approaches a wall he detects it and turns around. I guess the contrast of my dark floors and white baseboards and light beige curtains are what lets him detect them. Although he has several settings I set a time so each day he does his work then finds his way back home. Yes, he sometimes gets stuck on something, but not often. I close doors to bedrooms and bathrooms. I just want my living, dining and kitchen floors done. He is more quiet than any of my other vacuums, yes I have a few. But it's a vacuum. It's not silent. I'll try to post a video soon.After using Dee for a few days I got out my cordless Hoover and vacuumed as usual. I bought the Hoover just for the hard floors when I had less of them. It has a great light on the front that shows dust I can not otherwise see. I was shocked at how clean my floors were. Dee is my hero. That Hoover is a rock star too, but that's another story. I still have to push it around which makes Dee my new best friend.These photos show Dee parked in my dining room, recharging after a hard day's work, how dark my floors are, and some areas he does not fit into. I did not expect him to morph into a 2"""" machine and vacuum around my tchotchkes. Guess I'm just nice that way. When company is coming I put him in the laundry room. I'm fine with his home in my dining room. It's very much out of the way and mostly unseen unless we are having company.I could ramble on even longer but I hope you get the idea. If you want room mapping and auto emptying buy a more expensive model. If you just don't want to have to vacuum your floors everyday hire Dee. He's worth every penny. Oh, he comes with his own remote control and you can download an app for your smartphone. I have enough apps on my phone. With this remote I see no reason to get the app. Or maybe I'm missing some added features with the app? I don't know.

So let me put her job into perspective. We have a little modest home about 1500 sq. ft. Of which only our 3 bedrooms are carpeted. We have 2 boys, a medium sized dog, and I have an in home daycare so add 6 more children, Mon.-Fri..For the first two weeks I only allowed her on the hardwoods, closing off the bedrooms because I didn't expect much of her on my carpets, and I have a Shark Vacume that I use for my good heavy duty cleaning. She has done amazing, running once to twice a day. Quiet enough to run during naptime, picks up all of the dog hair, sand from the sandbox, and grass clippings that are carried in on tiny feet that go in and out throughout the day, and the massive amount of crumbs that fall during Lunch/snack time. She even gets under my couch!!! I no longer have to swiffer under there, she gets it all.So after the first two weeks, and being confident in her abilities, I opened up my bedroom door to give her a try on my carpet. Now this isn't a deep cleaning vacuum. I still feel the need to break out my Shark Pro vacuum about once a week. But I will say she does a pretty darn good job. The first two times she ran under my bed (a spot I rarely am able to clean under) she filled up her dust bin. It was mind blowing what she was picking up.She now has free range over my house, runs about an hour and a half to 2 hours at a time. Now she is a little all over the place, there isn't a lot of logic to her cleaning, but I dont care. She manages to get to job done, and I didn't spend $400 on a robotvac!!!

"2893,""Bought two N79 units when Amazon had them on a promoted sale for §149. LOVE them! Did follow it around on first run to identify areas where it could choke on extension cords/wires/low clearances and re-positioned obstructions/interferences as needed. We have low-pile oriental rugs and wood floors, and raised lintels between rooms, and Deebot handled all of these fine with flying colors. There is a stairs down to family room and Deebot edge detection successfully avoided falling down the stairs. Ecovacs Android wifi app works good although Deebot goes offline sometimes so I am going to try repositioning my Eero wifi living room beacon and/or reposition Ecovacs charging station so that Ecovacs and Eero are closer to each other, but basically very happy with Ecovacs app too. Repositioning Ecovac closer line-of-sight did not fix this intermittent offline status in the Android app which causes app to lose contact with Ecovac for a few minutes now and then. So far that's my only qualm with this Ecovac N79S.  UPDATE:  I found that simply by navigating to """"About"""" on the app somehow """"wakes up"""" the app and gets the vacs to read """"on-line"""" in the app, so the app problem is solved.UPDATE: I want to give this 6 stars because of they way the robot handles large objects that you would expect would jam it ... but they DON'T jam it !  Whenever I empty the dust bin of the ECOVACS N79S I find all kinds of large objects - 4 inch segements of rose stems, champagne metal cap, beer caps, large shards of glass (up to 1"""" across), sticks, small pebbles, small screws nuts and bolts (from work I was doing around house on electrical outlets) and NONE of these things on many vacuum runs has ever even once jammed up the robot ... and when I clean the robot dust bin I can just dump these large objects out of the vacuum robot ... they seem to just sit somewhere behind the dust bin but well away from the rollers and so therefore so far it seems nothing except a low clearance just slightly below the 3"""" this robot needs can stop this robot ... otherwise it just keeps going, and going, and going .....Our floors have never been so clean!

"2896,""I got this a few weeks ago, I had been wanting one for awhile. I was constantly vacuuming, I have a German Shepherd, 2 cats and then my daughter and I so there is literally hair everywhere.  My daughter decided it needed a name and Gerry was it. Gerry does a great job, I do empty him alot, but he does a lot of vaccuming. He goes under the couch, under, the dressers, ect. Absolutely amazing. I have this paranoia about letting Gerry work when we are not home, we've read the horror stories online about robo vacuums rynning over dog poo. So I only let him work while I'm here. It happen anyway though, my dog is well trained, but he does get sick on occasion today was one such day and I took Gerry apart and cleaned him. Lucky for me my dog ate a wipe, gross I know! But it made Gerry get stuck and he screamed for help (well he beeped) until I went to see what happen. The wipe got caught preventing the spread. My dog the night before had popped the child safetly lock on the the bathroom, which of course is to prevent him from going in there in order to get to the litter box and cat food. I guess he decided a wipe was a good idea too. Thankfully I had ordered some extra parts for Gerry and had them already. My one complaint about the design on this, which wont matter if you don't have children to spill things or pets to make messes is that when youbtakenit apart, all the electrical components are attached to the bottom. The bottom is what I needed to clean. Gerry is clean now and doing his job though, had he not got caught on something though I would have had poop spread about my house. Also we have a chair in the living room that Gerry gets stuck on daily. So there are definitely some cons for I'm happy, I no longer have German Shepherd hair balls blowing around my house if I don't vaccuming daily."",""Reviewed in the United States on May 18, 2019""";;;;;;;;

"2908,""Update TIP 1: Maybe it is just me, but I kept putting the filter box in the wrong way a dozen times. So, I placed a couple of stickers (you can use an address label) on the TOP part. Now, I get it right every time :) ...See my 1st picture.Update TIP 2: Someone asked about how much space the recharge needs. The booklet says it needs several feet on each side, BUT (see my 2nd picture), I was able to lay some old linoleum on the carpet for the unit to unite smoothly with the charger. You will see that it does not need a wide berth.I was one who thought a robot vacuum was a silly idea. I was vacuuming with my powerful Dirt Devil Jaguar Pet Vac about once a week. Each time, I would have to empty the canister two or three times.Then, BestBuy and Amazon had a price war during Mother's Day week of 2019. Both had dropped the price from around $249 to $159.  I had $50 in BestBuy gift cards doing E-Rewards surveys, so my cost was $109 (plus taxes).I figured if I didn't like it, I could give it away.I am hooked. After 4 days of daily cleaning, I noticed that the N79S was picking up less dirt. Then, I took my DareDevil Jaguar vacuum and did the whole house. This time, the canister was only HALF full. WOW! Now, I just do other stuff, like write this review, while the N79S hums along (not very noisy, unless you select power cleaning mode, which gets a bit louder, but not annoying).  And, you can select spot cleaning (it goes into concentric circles), or edge cleaning (it follows all the edges of a room/house), and more.The 4 stars for 'deep cleaning' is because the Dirt Devil Jaguar vacuum does a better job of sucking up trapped and deeper embedded sand/dirt at the carpeted area.PS, I noticed that it kept starting at midnight, until I read that you take the remote control and hold the Timer button (the top left, next to the round clock symbol, under the arrows) for a few seconds until it beeps or the Timer symbol on the remote screen disappears.Finally, the Jaguar Pet vacuum is now in hibernation :)  If you want to decide to get a robot vacuum, this one is a very good beginner's model."",""Reviewed in the United States on May 17, 2019""";;;;;;;;

I clicked on the link for support through Amazon, and they  tried to contact the supplier with no response.  They said they would continue to try, but I never heard back from them. .  What I realized is that it really doesn't need the internet .  It comes with a remote control that works very well and I have learned to love this option.  I have a very large house (1st floor about 2000 sq ft ) and it runs randomly.  It has very strong suction and if you use the remote option to clean the edges, it works most amazingly.  I am retired and at home most of the day, so if it misses a spot, I just redirect it with the remote.  When I empty the dirt container, I am amazed at how much it picks up.  It is also very quiet compared to my daughter's Roomba and that's exactly why I purchase this instead of a Roomba.  It is also smaller, so it fits nicely under beds, couches, and chairs.  I have many low nap area rugs  and hardwood throughout the house and it goes from one to the other without a problem.  It also goes over door strips and edges very well.  It does find the charger from time to time, but not always, so I just use the remote to direct it to the port if it can't find it.

"2923,""I love this robot. We have four dogs and the hair gets a little out of control sometimes but this vacuum has definitely cut down on the time I have to manually vacuum. There are a couple things about it that maybe could be addressed and may not be a problem with other robot vacuums, but the biggest thing is the brush getting clogged up. By design, these don't hold much in the dust bin but it would be nice if it could sense when it was full and then stop. If it gets full then it just keeps going and the main brush gets overwhelmed with hair until it eventually shuts itself off and starts beeping at you to clean it out. If you stay on top of it and just empty the bin every so often (depending on the hair level of your house) then that isn't an issue. It's kind of a pain to have to clean the hair out of it because it gets so tightly wound around it. Emptying the bin is a 10 second job so I have certainly tried to remember to empty that out while the vacuum is working.A couple other things is the smart home control is great. I just tell Google to start it or dock it and it responds quickly and easily. I do find myself using the remote or the direction controls in the Ecovacs app to get a few spots that the vacuum occasionally missed but that is rare if you leave it to sweep the duration of the battery (which is roughly 90 minutes or so in my experience).Overall, a really great device to have in the house. Cuts down on your cleaning time exponentially and compared to other vacuums, is a great value. Highly recommended!"",""Reviewed in the United States on May 15, 2019""";;;;;;;;
"2924,""We have only had this for a day and OH MY has it cleaned quite a lot.Dust bunnies under my sofa, corners of my hallways, pet dander and hair, etc. We like it a lot so far.Settings: I have used the 'room perimeter' setting the most so far. 'Auto' setting is fine, though it travels randomly without really cleaning a whole room 100% before moving on. The 'one room' setting doesn't really work well for me, as we have an open floor plan main level.Cleaning: This thing really does clean well. It gets hair, dust, pet dander, and so on. So far, I notice it doesn't suck up heavy particles like litter or food well. The litter it sucked up fell out a bit when I empty the suction compartment. Otherwise, no complaints.Robot intelligence: Being as this is our first robot vacuum, we are quite satisfied with it. It does have an app with several nice features (alarm, suction power, a direct remote control to 'drive') and it comes with a remote control. I can see why other people would opt for something smarter, as this little robot just kind of goes hither and yon, not exactly 100% cleaning one location before moving on.Overall: For me, this is a great addition to my cleaning regime. I'm always home so far when I use it and I'll set it in the bedrooms I need cleaned or do my best to adjust it when it needs.Issues: It has gotten stuck a few times on one of my shag rugs. It tries to 'right' itself, but as long as I'm home to help it out, no problem. Today it managed to get stuck under my couch, which was a first.

"2949,"" For a month or two I LOVED my deebot BUT after that the deebot lost the sensor or something (if that’s what it’s called) and it literally CRASHES into everything. The wall, My floor length mirrors and corner vases. I don’t know what to do and I can’t seem to get in contact with ECOVACS about changing it for another one for a bit more money or getting it checked out by them.P.S i COMPLETELY lovedddd this deebot and I honestly don’t know if my deebot might’ve been the one in the bunch to be defective so don’t let my post discourage you.P.p.s the deebot is a little loud but not as loud as other brands I’ve came across.Really hoping the company will reach out so that I can get a fixed one and change my rating."",""Reviewed in the United States on May 13, 2019""";;;;;;;;

"2951,""I purchased my Deebot October, 2018 so I’ve had her for about seven months. She’s probably the best money I’ve ever spent and not much makes me happier than coming home and emptying her little bin and knowing the floor is clean and I basically did no work at all. I live alone- no kids, no pets- and she’s set to automatically run every day. I’m regularly surprised by how much she picks up, every single time she runs. Where the heck does she find all that dust and dirt??All that awesomeness aside, I’m writing this review now because little Alice (that’s what I named the vacuum) met with a major disaster this past weekend.A good friend is moving and I hosted a going away party for her. My friend and her husband came to my house and brought their Greyhound. The party was outside but Alice and the dog stayed inside. Late in the night, doggy daddy went inside to check on his dog and came back out in a bit of a panic.“How do you turn Alice off?”, he asked.I was a little confused because her automatic run time is set for 10am. He asked again, with a bit more urgency, “Seriously. How do you turn her off??”I go inside my house to find a horrific scene. The very large Greyhound has made a VERY large pile of very wet poo....and Alice has been trying to clean it up. I won’t go into the details of how far and wide the poo had been stretched across my house- but it was bad. Really, really bad.Cleaning the floor and baseboards took quite a long time and we were exhausted. Alice was in bad shape and I really figured she would end up in the vacuum graveyard. I wiped her exterior and wrapped her in a towel to deal with in the morning.The next day I began the task of trying to fix my beloved Alice. I took her apart- side brushes, main brush and filter off and tried to brush away all the poo. It was EVERYWHERE and my brush wasn’t doing any good. I was frustrated and Alice was filthy. In a last ditch effort of desperation, I took my kitchen sink sprayer to her.  I didn’t think she would possibly survive but I had to give her a chance.I dried her out with a hair dryer and let her sit for a couple hours. I put her on her charger and she lit up! Could it be possible she was going to work again? No way, I thought. 24 hours later, little Alice is happily cleaning my floor again. Like nothing ever happened. I don’t know what she’s made from but if you’re looking for a robot vacuum, I absolutely recommend the Deebot. I was already in love with my Alice but after this weekend I will tell every single person I know. Buy the Deebot!!! For the price, it absolutely cannot be beat in my book."",""Reviewed in the United States on May 13, 2019""";;;;;;;;

"2955,""Arrived in perfect condition. We named him Ultron (you can change the vacuum’s name in the app).He does the drunken sailor stumbling navigation around the house and he does a pretty good job of it. It’s impressive just how much stuff he picks up. With two kids, two cats, and two adults (one of whom has long hair), there’s a lot of fur/hair/debris that’s always being picked up.Ultron’s suction is pretty effective. He inhaled a Mardi Gras necklace, legos, and hair ties without batting a robotic eye.Now that my kids know Ultron will vacuum up there stuff, they’ve gotten quite speedy and picking up the floor when Ultron leaves his docking station and gives his “hello” chime.We run him during the day when I telecommute or on weekends where we can keep an eye on him. He gets stuck on things and we need to go save him (it’s cute at this point).  If our furniture were less challenging or we had fewer cords around the house, we could let him vacuum unattended without much issue. You can tell he’s in the room but I don’t need to adjust anything I’m doing (he’s not loud).So far, neither cat has hopped on him for a ride. Still hopeful."",""Reviewed in the United States on May 12, 2019""";;;;;;;;

I have tile throughout my house, except in the bedrooms where I have low pile carpet, and this bot does an such an amazing job in all the rooms! I set a daily schedule for it to run and she sets to work without fail. It's super quiet and runs for almost 2 hours. The waste bin is easy to empty as it just slides out the back of the bot, so you don't have to tip it over. I have two very messy boys that make it their life's work to leave as much crumbs on the floor as possible and a cat that sheds half it's body weight on the daily and this bot keeps up with all of them. This thing is incredible! I have also installed the app on my phone which is super user friendly. All in all, best purchase ever!

I had high hopes, but the first problem was that it couldn't connect to the app via WiFi after several attempts.  After reviewing helpful troubleshooting techniques such as """"make sure your router is connected to the Internet"""" and """"make sure the robot is turned on"""" I gave up on that.  No worries, I thought, I'll just schedule it using the supplied remote control.  Nope.  I just wanted the robot to run every night at 3 am: no big deal.  The first night it seemed to run as desired.  But after that, nothing.  I played around artificially setting the clock to 2:59 am and waiting for the thing to turn on.  It did once or twice, but not reliably.

"2966,"" Premise: we have a Roomba 805 that started to have problem with docking/charging after less than one year use, so we decided to give this Deebot a try since it was on sale. This review is basically a comparison between these two vacuum models: Deebot N79s vs Roomba 805.Pros of Deebot: light weight, quiet, better docking.Cons: less suction power, and the most serious drawback imo is how it maneuvers the whole floor.I found it very easily to get stuck “by itself”, without any obstacles. If it gets stuck under dining table and chairs, fine, I can understand that. But what’s going on to get stuck in an open space??? Today it just got stuck in my kitchen for 30min and can’t find a way to get out. See the video attached. As a comparison I also ran Roomba in the same space, and it doesn’t have any problem to sweep the whole floor and finished that area in less than 2min. This is not the first time it gets stuck in open space, but just find it really ridiculous to get lost in such an open and clean area. It is like getting a fancy cellphone that has problem making a basic phone call!"",""Reviewed in the United States on May 11, 2019""";;;;;;;;
"2967,""Full disclosure . . . my house is one level, 1K square feet. No carpet, all dark HW or tile, with some rugs but none deep. I have bad back & a cat, no one else to deal with.This vacuum is PERFECT for me. The cat is a manufacturer of mass hair quantities. But every other day this little disc spends an hour zig-zagging thru house and when I send it to its home base, the floors look so good. Are they perfect? Do they look Hazel herself hit every square inch with a wisk-broom? No. But they look good enough to induce unsolicited compliments.Maintenance cleaning of the unit is easy & quick. It's not very loud, noticable but not noisey.
