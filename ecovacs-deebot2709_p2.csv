It functions great and even has a few extra programs like spot clean and side clean. It also has a reliable time function. My favorite function is the ability to control the robot’s directional path with the remote. It’s like a remote control car.

"1015,""This was the second Ecovacs Deebot I have purchased and the second one to crap out after less than two years of use. After I purchased my first one, I liked it so much I purchased a second one a few months later. Both worked great for a season. After about 16 months of use, the first one died. I contacted Ecovacs to see if they offered any repair service or could do anything, but they could/would not because it was after the 12 month warranty had expired. Thinking maybe it was an anomaly, I purchased a third Ecovacs Deebot to replace the broken one. This time though, I got the extended warranty and suspect I will need it. Well, as of this week, after 20 months of use, my second one died also. Maybe I’m old fashioned, but I expect a household appliance that costs hundreds of dollars to last more than two years.

I am very impressed with the craftsmanship and quality.It does well not bumping into things often. You can even drive it around with the app on your phone like it's a remote control car!

I wanted to get myself one for Christmas but was hoping the Roombas would go on sale more than they did. I read the reviews for this one and they seemed great so I didn’t understand why anyone would spend $150+ more dollars when this one was working so well. I’ve since found out why. I named it Toto and my husband named it dumb***. It gets stuck on EVERYTHING! A vent on the floor.. the lip of the fridge.. under the crib.. under the computer chair.. etc. each time I blocked where it was getting stuck it would find a new place and I have yet to come home and find it back on it’s charger - I have to press the alarm button to find what new place it got stuck. Now I only run it when we’re at home and my husband and I are going multiple times to “rescue Toto” which takes as much effort as just vacuuming the house.

The vacuum was never that good to start with. Bumps every wall and will always run over your feet. I sweep everyday because I have four pets, but this was just a nice backup.

Then it was starting to stop and beep and the side brushes would stop spinning. I have a feeling that the side brushes are going out because of the random cleaning it does and bumping into everything. I think this because the brushes stop spinning for a bit then when it bumps into something like a wall or door it seems like it glitches and starts spinning again.

"1074,""This little guy is fantastic. Yes, it's a random only. Yes, it's kind of dumb sometimes. But....it works.We run our Deebot in each room every other day (kitchen/living area one day, bedroom another day). With hardwood and a low-pile carpet, it keeps picking things up.- Alexa integration: it's nice to have, but limited. You can tell it to start, stop, ask it where it is (it beeps), and to go home and charge. You cannot change modes.- App integration: Functional remote with status. Can select everything you can on the remote, but also gives status. The app isn't required, but recommended.- WiFi: Haven't had it disconnect.- Navigation: The IR proximity sensors help it avoid obstacles but it's not perfect. It's wide enough for doors, walls, etc, but it generally won't see narrow objects like a chair leg. Otherwise, it's a lite bump.- Performance: It works well. It keeps picking things up and generally keeps itself clean. Note, we do not have pets. The bucket needs to be emptied about every two room cleanups (say, 800 sq. ft.) but it's easy to do.- Failures: There are some cases where it can get stuck. Rugs with fringe or fuzzy bathroom rugs. These were getting the side brushes tangled. Additionally, there are some vertical geometries to be aware of in the kitchen. With those thick padded standing mats, it can sometimes wedge itself underneath the edge of the cabinet and the rug. Either way, it senses that something is wrong, stops, and beeps (app will notify).- Minor annoyance: The Deebot has preset programs, that you can modify on the fly (say MAX vacuum setting versus normal). But, they do not stick and have to be set every time. Additionally, I don't think the remote allows you to set the vacuum pressure";" it's only available in the app.Overall, for how cheap it was on a Daily Deal and our first foray into robot vacuums, this thing has been great at keeping our floor clean."",""Reviewed in the United States on December 20, 2019""";;;;;;;;

It wasn't before long about 4 months into using it everyday that it broke and would no longer work.  The other disappointment about it was that instead of being able to map the house, it would just clean at random intervals with no real sense of I cleaned this line and moving over to the next row it would instead just zig zag...it typically would get most of everything before it ran out of battery and had to recharge.Since the item didn't last long and did an okay job for what it did, I do not recommend this product at all.

It cleans all the places that were hard or impossible to get with our conventional vacuum - under the beds, sofas, chairs, and other low furniture.

It transitions to low pile rugs from hard floor and back without problems.It has all the features we need, and is a great value (we paid $150 on sale). I can't think of any features that we'd want other that it doesn't have. We have not tried it with Alexa yet. Kind of fun to watch it, too.A couple of things to watch out for that we not in the product description:1) The instructions warn against using this with tassled rugs.

"1103,""I have had this guy for about 4 months, and after trying to love him and make it work, I just can't get over the generally poor performance. I have one pet (a medium-sized dog) and this definitely cannot handle even moderate amounts of fur. Giant balls of hair and dust are left in every room, and I frequently (about 2x er use) have to take out the brush and pull the hair out of it because it stops running and beeps incessantly until it's cleaned. I promise I do not have a particularly dirty house (I do a full floor sweep/mop weekly - this is just for in between). And it's not just an issue with the pet hair. After locking it in a room that my dog is not allowed in, I now have balls of dust everywhere. The cartridge was not full or anything, I think the design just gathers up stuff into a little ball until it can't handle it anymore and it just leaves them (anyone else remember Katamari Damacy? Like that). Anyway, I need to stop writing and vaccum with my upright immediately because it's gross in there.TLDR";" if you want all your home's dust and hair gathered into little balls and left everywhere, get this machine.

"1127,""First of all, I bought this hoping to have some help with the enormous amount of hair that my yellow Labrador sheds all over the house. This robot vacuum cleaner has solved that problem. I run it every day, and now I never see the little poofs of dog hair in every corner.  I give this five stars because it actually works better than my regular vacuum cleaner, it reaches hard to reach places and does a great job around corners.Things to know:1.  Don’t expect this to vacuum like a human. It uses a zigzag type pattern, so initially it may look like it’s going to skip over a spot, but if you let it work as intended, it will get back to that place.2.  It does have some limitations. My house is 2300 ft.², so it will do a good job if I let it work on the whole house at one time, but it is optimal, if I let it work on one part and complete a cycle and then later on the day when it is fully charged, I’ll let it do the second half of the house.3.  You need to empty this out every time it is used, but this only takes a minute.4.  I use mine so much, that I have already needed to buy some replacement parts, but those were not very expensive on Amazon.com and this is a little trade off for such a great help to me. I bought a whole set of replacement parts for about $20, so I’m set, most likely, for the year.5.

Not a big deal compared to how efficient this little robot is.  I researched reviews and talked to friends who have both DEEBOT and ROOMBA - the only difference I can tell between this and ROOMBA is the  mapping capability.  I chose Deebot because it is a fraction of the cost of Roomba and the mapping of the Roomba can be more frustrating to set up than I wanted to endure.

I suspect that these reviewers accidentally flipped the side switch off, and are trying to reactivate the DeeBot by only using the top button.  Hubby and I spent 30 minutes troubleshooting and were ready to replace DeeBot the first time it happened... laughed at ourselves when we realized that all we needed to do to """"fix"""" it was flip the on switch (which is different than the """"activate"""" button).100% happy with this purchase, it saves me at LEAST 2 hours a week... and our socks stay white because our hardwood floors are so clean!  16 months and going strong!"",""Reviewed in the United States on December 12, 2019""";;;;;;;;;

Turns out that our replacement doesn’t charge on the charging pad either. I also just learned that the one I bought for my parents stopped charging as well.

"1155,""Love this! We originally bought and still have the 500 series, both work amazingly. We have hard wood floors and tile in our whole house with area rugs here and there along with 3 German Shepherds and 3 boys. We run both at the same time to decrease cleaning time and increase the ability to run multiple times a day (like I said we have 3dogs and boys). The only thing I wish they did better was get in the corners (nothing a quick broom doesn't fix). We have also since bought one for our parents. Highly recommend to anyone who is low on time and high on the need for quick easy cleaning. Ease of set up and running makes this so user friendly.

"1173,""Trust me when I say this. Trust me really well. This product is good...for a year. There is a reason why the “warranty” only covers for a year. Because after that year ends, it will basically become a door stop at this point. After a year of having it and taking care of it and cleaning it all the time and maintaining it, a “main brush error” comes up. This causes the Deebot to no longer move and beep until you just shut it off completely. Mind you, I really only had this thing be used 3 times a week. So, I figured “hey I’ll clean it off.” Nothing, and the brush doesn’t move, causing the error. So, like anyone, you think “I’ll just buy a new brush, then BOOM, it’ll be back to normal.” So, I buy one, install it, and of course, same error occurs. So, I call the customer service of ECOVACS, and I get “yeah we won’t be able to help because it’s past the warranty and there is no service center near where you live.” Mind you, the warranty is only 2 months past. So, they know what they are doing.So, in conclusion, if you want a good cleaning product for a year, then hey, this isn’t a bad option. HOWEVER, if you are like me, someone who figured if I just take care of it and make sure I clean it often and it’ll last for years, then STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT.

One day it might clean the whole floor, the next it might decide to spend 90% of its time stuck under a chair.2) It will not transition from a hard floor to a rug. It even has trouble getting onto my 1/4 thin bathroom rug, and often gets stuck doing so.3) Getting replacement parts for this brand is a royal pain.

When the unit was working, it did take quite awhile time to run its course (1500 ft area), and frankly, could drive a person crazy unless you walk away and forget the crazy patterns it cleans in.  The charge usually lasted a good amount of time and did pick up quite an impressive amount of small debris for not being a conventional vacuum. (Better than the small stick units.) However, and this is the major complaint- even with routine maintenance, it lasted an unacceptable amount of time before the Deebot stopped working altogether. First sign of malfunction was it just cleaning in circles. Of course, trying to troubleshoot, checking that it wasn’t in “spot cleaning” mode, taking the bumper from and checking for stray debris, following every direction several times over to no avail,  RENDERING THIS UNIT USELESS. The response from the barely existent customer service was to “hold onto the unit,” and “maybe in the future they will have a repair dept.” !! What a horrible way to conduct business!

"1210,""I purchased this machine in July 2018 and was initially impressed with it because it saved me the headache of vacuuming and also kept the house cleaner than I could since I could have it vacuum daily whereas I may only vacuum weekly. Additionally, this machine picked up so much dirt daily that I did not even realize was there. Unfortunately, that is the extent of the benefits of this device.The machine works like a chicken with its head cut off and does not follow a pattern which often leads to it missing areas of a room. The app is subpar and often randomly resets the schedule cleaning times. The remote randomly lost its connection to the machine. The machine only supports 2.4ghz and not 5ghz so if you have google wifi where it automatically decides the band, you will struggle to connect the deebot to your devices. The machine allegedly supports google home and amazon alexa"; however, I have been unable to make it work with either of those assistants.Regardless of all those flaws, I was happy with the machine because it made my life easier--after all, thats what machines are for. And then I got the dreaded 4 beep error. The machine beeps nonstop in sets of 4. Initially, I thought this was because the main brush had hair in it. I took apart the main brush and cleaned up a TON of hair; however, this did not solve the beeping issue. After more research, I found out that the battery has reached the end of its life. After less than 18 months, the battery on this device crapped out and rendered the device inoperable. I reached out to ecovacs in hopes of getting a replacement battery under warranty;" however, their warranty for the entire device is only 1 year.It is abundantly clear that this is a case of planned obsolescence and that deebot devices have a lifespan of less than 2 years.

It does not “map out” your space, it just waits until it hits a wall & turns back around on an angle. It’s the roomba’s dumb cousin.  I made a mess it in my room & it did clean it all up. I had to lock it in because it kept trying to leave. It is obsessed with my couch spending 80% of the time in my living room cleaning under the couch. I have a raised couch with slim legs, it’s not stuck underneath it just loves going back to it over &over. Some positives, it’s quieter then the roomba, it eventually cleans the whole space, my dog only slightly hates it. I’ll write an update review in a few weeks."",""Reviewed in the United States on December 4, 2019""";;;;;;;;;

I contacted Consumer Service at the company, & was told it is out of warrantee & the best they can do is refer me to the repair dept- Unfortunately, they are not open until later in the month, & it will be at my expense- I'm sure between the shipping & repair it will hardly be worth fixing- As a Prime member, I thought Amazon could help, but they are disinterested.

"1221,""We have had (Ed as he is named) for 3 days, and I am in love.  This is the handiest creature in the house.  Bought him on Black Friday.  He was not the most expensive model, but it is hard to believe that the higher priced ones could work any better.  He has picked up dog and cat hair in places I didn't know it existed.  There has been no problem with throw rugs, fringe or any other issues I was concerned about.  He had a wonderful time under the bed and picked up an accumulation of dust.  It is embarrassing how much I missed in my cleaning routine.  I have two cats and a litter box in my laundry room.  He picked up all the grains that cats track.  He even picked up whatever was caught in a throw rug and also grains that were trapped in a sponge rubber mat that was beside the litter box.  I had tried shaking to get the grains out to no avail, and Ed took care of the problem.

"1239,""I read somewhere that the DN79S is the same thing as the DN622.11.  First,  I hate writing reviews so the fact that I'm writing this says something.  We bought it about 6-7 months ago?  And after the first few days we said if this thing only lasts us half a year, it would have cost us about $1 a day and we asked ourselves if it was worth it.  Completely! and we normally wouldn't say that.  We figured we would run it everyday for the first week and then figured we'd only run it every other day or every third day after that.  Were we wrong!  We run it every day - plus often spot clean around the island counter because our kids are messy eaters.  We have a boxer and didn't even think it shed that much.  We were wrong again.  My Honey empties the Deebot everyday and he says he's """"disgusted"""" with what a good job it does.  """"It gives you low self esteem.""""  Low self esteem aside, we are very happy with it.We read a funny review of this when we bought it in the spring saying the Deebot is great but it is sometimes dumb.  Sometimes it takes more than 5 minutes for the unit to find the docking station.  Sometimes it's within 10 feet of the docking station and it starts to veer off somewhere else.  It gets caught on cords,strings, backpack straps, shoelaces,  and paper towels - but we are really at fault for that.  We have a small powder room and sometimes it gets stuck behind the toilet.Installing the App was simple enough for our then 9 year old to do it for us.  (Though that doesn't speak to whether we could have done it ourselves or  not.)  You can change the cleaning schedule via the App - we turned it off while we were at the beach.  You can set it to run every day or whatever days you want.  You can have multiple cleaning schedules.  You can turn it on manually and steer it with the remote.  For some reason, i's hugely gratifying to steer it to clean a small area instead of getting out the dust pan and brush.  It has a room cleaning feature though we never bothered to learn how to do it.  (I'll ask my 10 year old to set it up one of these days)  It has an edging feature to go around the room and it remembers eventually where all the permanent walls and furniture is.  It also seems to sense when there is an obstacle in front of it but we're not sure because it has such a RANDOM cleaning pattern.  If there is an actual pattern or algorithm, we haven't figure it out yet.  But it gets the job done. (98% of it anyway)  If you at some point don't just stand there and watch it clean for awhile, then you're a better person than we are.  I am sometimes mesmerized by it.We thought the dog would go crazy around it but he just ignores it.  He's a 75 Lbs dog that has stepped on it accidentally a number of times and SirCleansALot (that's what our daughter named it) doesn't seem worse for the wear.It has a standard and a maximum vacuum setting but we only run it on the standard suction.  (Think how low our self esteem would be on the maximum setting).  It doesn't suck up our dog's food on the standard settings sometimes - but probably because the pieces are too big.Both filters and brushes can all be replaced - the App has an indicator that lets you know about when the items should be replaced but use your good judgement and then you can reset the reminder once you've replaced the items.  It's most economical to buy the packages that has everything.The Deebot really works best for people who have all one flooring like hardwood or vinyl planks or tile, etc.  We also have low weave area rugs at all three of our doors and it has no problems with them.The noise seems loud when it starts but it quickly becomes background noise.  We can't use it at night because I'm a light sleeper.  The run noise itself doesn't bother me but the beeping when it turns on and when it docks is really loud and wakes me up because we live in an open concept house.Totally worth it.  And if it isn't worth it to you, return it - but it's worth giving it a try.  It really keeps our floors so much cleaner.  I haven't really brought out the broom since we bought this.  It's kind of like having a maid come to you house and sweeping/vacuuming your floors every day.  (I only gave a 4 for deep cleaning because we don't have plush rugs so we don't know.)"",""Reviewed in the United States on December 2, 2019""";;;;;;;;;

But I love that it goes under the sofas, under my bed, under the armoirs, it goes under everyTHING.  Hard to do every time you sweep even if you do have OCD about dust under the fridge and stove.  No, it does not go under the fridge and stove, but I now have time to do that myself because this thing is cleaning the rest of the house.  It picks up glitter from Christmases past and present for crying out loud.

However the warranty replacement failed with a main brush issue after 8-9 months. Only ran it twice a week so it wasn't overused or abused.

It picks up a decent amount of dust and dirt especially from furniture that I fail to clean under regularly. It's roughly 2 hour battery life is good, as its not a smart vacuum in the sense that it doesn't map your house, it simply meanders around. It can be quite annoying to watch it clean a corner or under the same chair for 15 minutes. While we're on annoying, if you run this while you're home its like having someone with little hand held vacuums following you around for 2 hours. If you think you can ignore this more power to you. Feel free to run it while you're not home but if you have an alarm with a motion sensor the vacuum will set it off.This is not a set up and forget type of device. It does require some TLC. Depending on your hair you should check the brushes and rollers regularly. It also needs to be emptied on occasion. Aim for every 3-5 uses. Parts will also need to be replaced on occasion.Cords. This little robot loves to eat up cords. Any cord it can get its greedy little brushes on, it will attempt to eat and then proceed to drag them all over the house until it senses a problem and shuts down. This shut down is inconsistent and I've had it rip out phone charges and then drag said phones around the house. This could be a concern if you have any light items that could be dragged off of high shelves or tables and break. At least if it does this it'll clean up its own mess. Make sure you keep all cords off the floor where this device will be operating. Some simple Velcro cord controllers sold everywhere will do the trick and they're cheap.The App. The app is easy enough to use and understand. It also has features telling you when to replace various parts of the machine. Brushes, filters, rollers, etc. It looks like these are on a timer and don't actually take into account the actual state of these parts, use your best judgement. You can also use the app to control this little guy like a RC car.Overall I'm pleased with this vacuum and I would buy it again. For the price you can't go wrong.

No, it does not do as good of a job as a standard vaccum cleaner, but it cleans up 95% of the mess both on my hard floors and my thick rugs.It goes from hard flooring to carpet seamlessly (though it's mush louder on the carpet). Since it only has random pathing, it does get stuck pretty often, but not super easily. I have had more problems with it not being able to find its base when the battery is low than I have with it actually getting stuck on things.The app is great!

We have 2 cats, a dog, and a toddler and only ran the Deebot every other day (while sweeping & vacuuming daily). We made sure to keep the debris bin emptied and took meticulous care of it, but one day we started getting an error message that said """"Main Brush Malfunction"""". We replaced the main brush, thinking it was just old, but that didn't work. We cleaned the whole machine with no luck. We then started Googling and found this to be a common problem & found a video by someone showing how to solve the issue - by taking apart the main brush motor and cleaning it out for debris. My husband did so, put it back together, and we continued to get the same error message. At this point I contacted customer service and asked if we could purchase a replacement motor --- their response was that we were unfortunately outside of our 1-year warranty period and they don't sell replacement parts, but that there would be repair shops opening in the US in the coming years. They also sent a link to a video that """"others have found to be helpful"""" - and it was the same video that we had already found on our own. We now have an expensive piece of equipment taking up room in our home that is useless, because it will not run.I'm extremely disappointed in the lack of quality of not only the product but also the support from Customer Service, and after discussing with other EcoVacs product owners have found this to be a common thread.

"1431,""I recieved this vacuum as a Christmas present from my husband in 2017. At the time, we were both working full time and with 3 dogs, I could never keep up with the dog hair. In the beginning, this this was awesome! I loved how clean the floors were. We live in a 1500sqft ranch house, the only carpeted area are 2 out of 3 bedrooms but we keep the bedroom doors closed because of the dogs so the vacuum only runs in the hallway (wood laminate), kitchen (tile) and livingroom (wood laminate) which had a large area rug. The vacuum runs until the battery is low which is about 2 hours but it seemed to get stuck just about anywhere! We pretty much ended up having to vacuum proof our house so we didnt come home to a job half done, we even got rid of our large area rug in the living room. In fall 2018, the vacuum started malfunctioning so we had to contact customer service. There was no phone number to contact them so everything had to be done by email. They were very nice and replaced the vacuum since it was under warranty. Things seem to be ok, the vacuum was still getting stuck sometimes and it kind of became the norm for us to have to redirect it every once in a while. My biggest complaint with this new replacement is that it's been about a year since we recieved and it went from vacuuming our hallway, kitchen and livingroom for 2 hours to barely running for 30 mins before the battery drains and calls it quits! We only run the vacuum once a day at 7am and then its left to charge the rest of the day and night but even then the thing only runs for 30 mins tops and barely gets the hallway done.

Finally ordered this and I am thrilled with it.  I have to clean it out quite often, so I know it's catching fur and dust. It's fairly quiet and, surprisingly, my skittish cat who hates the vacuum and plastic bags, is merely interested in it, usually watching from the bed.  I've been running it a couple of times a day in different parts of the house and it does fine with different surfaces.  (Right off the bat, it ran into a forgotten mouse glue trap and had to be rescued and cleaned.)  I've been frustrated that I haven't been able to hook it up with Alexa.

On a hard surface floor like the one in the video attached to this review the vacuum does  Out standing. It picks up dog hair stray pieces of carpet and crumbs at or under the kitchen counter that my kids have left That the dog couldn't find. Obviously at this price point you are not going to get a robot vacuum that maps out your entire house and memorizes the floor plan and everywhere it has been. But even without those features it does one heck of a job. The little robot roams around the house making sure not to bump into anything or even fall down stairs if you have an open stairwell. In the video you will also see that if you have a very tall rug or shag  Rug it may even avoid it which is what we want for the type of rug you see in the video. It does romeu into our kids rooms who have shorter carpet and while it does seem to slow down a little bit it vacuums around their Room without any problemThe only real issue we've Had is that sometimes it gets stuck underneath our fridge, Which this may just be unique to our house or the type of fridge we have. Everything else where it can it will slip under and tables chairs and other furniture that sits up high enough. After about 45 minutes or an hour of letting it run you will want to make sure that you clean out The tray that collects everything it picks up.We have yet to, in over 2 years, had to untangle any hair or anything from the brush underneath the vacuum. The remote is simple and has commands on it such as vacuum the perimeter of your home or start in a circle or you can even control where the vacuum goes with directional buttons on the remote.Overall I am pretty satisfied with this robot vacuum.

The machine never had malfunctions or cause troubles.  Since it lost the suction, I move the the vacuum room by room after 1 hour use, pick up about 80% of dusts.

"1487,""Day 1:  I received this bot vacuum today.  I had no great expectations for it.  I was looking for a bot vac to help keep the hardwoods less dusty, since I work full time and do not want to spend the end of each of my days cleaning the floor.  I expressly did not buy the Rooma since I heard it was so noisy.I do not have pets and our household has just two people who are pretty diligent about not tracking in lots of dirt, if that is possible.  After Amazon delivered today, I set it up, and actually read the instructions, and let it go do its thing.  I was pretty amused at watching it.  Tried out the auto setting, edge cleaning and single room cleaning.  I guess I have to admit that I assumed before I purchased it that it would """"mow the lawn"""" when vacuuming.  Discovered pretty quickly, that was not the case.  It has a mind of its own.  When approaching table legs, chair legs, it would take off in an unexpected direction.  Many areas it never touched since it had such an erratic pattern of travel in all modes I tried.  I had to follow it and use the remote to redirect it back to the room and area I wanted it to clean - that probably took more time than it would have for me to vacuum manually.  Afterward, I looked further at some of the lower rated reviews here and agree with several people who only gave it a 3 star rating on several  points.  It is quiet.  It did pick up quite a lot of dirt, as evidenced when I emptied the dust bin.  However, I have, as many reviewers here mentioned, an open floor plan.  I attempted to block off areas to prevent the bot from entering, but that just confused it more.  It missed a lot of areas and wanted to go over certain areas again and again. Agree with the reviewers that the little guy cannot find HOME, I finally gave up and picked it up and put it on the base, and I tried this several times later with same results.  It appears on day 1 that it does a decent job for the price paid, but will not clean entire floor area since its track is not consistent.  Will update after future use if my opinion changes.  As I said at the get-go, I had no great expectations.  I did really want to be surprised.  But I am not, so expectation was accurate."",""Reviewed in the United States on November 1, 2019""";;;;;;;;;

Once you've followed the Quick Start instructions for connecting the vacuum to the internet (also simple, as long as you do exactly what it says), you can just ask Alexa to turn on Deebot. It won't, because it's not connected, but Alexa will tell you she's sending you a card on the Alexa app that will guide you through setup. Once you've followed that guide, you're all done.

I first had problems three months into owning. I emailed the company and they were always very prompt into messaging me back but always had suggestions on what I could do to get this thing to work. I have needed up taking this things apart more times than I can count with no results. They finally say they will fix it and send it back. It took over three months to get my vacuum back and then it has the same problems a few months later and not they say the warrant is up even though I haven’t had the new one very long. Their last advice to me was to “ hit the vacuum very hard repeatedly until it works” what wonderful advice. Let’s face it all I have ever wanted to do was “hit this vacuum very hard” all along.

Once it arrived I reset it up, and we were off and running again!!!

I love this machine for everything else, but now I have to contact the manufacturer again in regards to the wheels.

I have a cheap vacu-bot now but it was no help and I had to manually charge it which I hated. I now only dust every 2 weeks and spot vacuum, under and behind things the bot can't get to, every 2.5 to 3 weeks as needed.  I tell Alexa to start cleaning and off it goes. When finished, about 90 min on low suction or 60 min on high, it flawlessly docks and charges. The N79S has only missed docking twice and only because I forgot to move a plush carpet first. Just make sure you don't hide it in a dark corner or down a small hallway, needs to be a bit in the open for the bot to see it. When it needs to charge it will wander a bit, enough that you may think its lost but, give it a chance! It will find the base. The edge feature is awesome. Will edge clean the entire house in under 30 minutes. The over sized collection bin is great. Holds a ton of fur. If it gets stuck under a table it seems to go into edge cleaning and always finds it's way out. The bin, brushes and filters are very easy to clean and change when needed. And, customer service is second to none! I sent an email after closing time and they responded back in less than 5 minutes to take care of a small problem.

"1613,""I didn't enable  Alexa so I can't speak to that.  Some of the negative reviews seem to be expecting a lot out of this little vac.  It cleans fine for what I expect of it.  I usually run it once between cleaning lady visits to get surface stuff- crumbs and such.  Or when the exposed wood floor is gritty.  It goes under the furniture which helps cut down on dust bunnies.  The dust chamber is small so if I'm running it over the whole (Ranch) house I need to dump it frequently. It's quirky.  It really does need to be supervised.  I would never let it run while I'm not here.  It likes pick up cords and run around with them. It can pull lamps off if I don't move the cord. It likes to bully the stools in the kitchen and needs to be redirected.  We have a lot of small and large area rugs.  I don't have a problem with it changing from wood to rugs, but it sometimes likes to sit and chew on the edge of a rug.  One review said it can't find it's home base.  I have the opposite problem- it doesn't like to be too far away from the base.  If I want it to clean in one part of the house, I have to shut the doors to rooms in the part where the charger is or it will not go to the other parts of the house.For the price, it's fine.

I don't have pets or children and vacuumed weekly. I didn't think my floors were so dirty. They are.2. You have to pick up your house before you let your robot vacuum. Vlad has picked up a lot of things, especially phone cords.3. Your robot will get stuck in the most random places. For sure under your couch, possibly your air conditioning grate, your kitchen rug.4. Run your vacuum while you're home so you can rescue 'em.5. You need to run your robot at least five days a week to vacuum your house.

The Manufacturer gave me a pretty extensive set on instructions I should follow to eliminate this from happening. None of them worked. The trick is to program its internal clock to a cleaning schedule that works for you. But if you set the time accurately - it will turn on at midnight, every night, all the time.

"1664,""I love this vacuum.  I use it on hardwood, laminate, and rugs.  I've tried it on the carpeted surfaces upstairs but it's just not worth it as it doesn't do that great of a job on anything that is above very low pile.  As other reviews say, it does have some trouble finding it's home base if it's not in a very obvious location.  It took a few tries to find the best place to stage the charger so that it can find it's home and in the time that it didn't go home, it's not a big deal to pick it up and put it back on the charger.I have a short hair dog and it picks up his hair no problem - sometimes it picks up marbles if the kids don't get every last one before we run it.  It's excellent at picking up sand and other small debris.  Sometimes it will just kick things out of the way instead of picking it up with the sweepers but it's minimal.I love this vacuum.  I just have to pick up and push start, not pick up all the things and then push the vacuum around (I do still push the Miele around about once a month to do the corners and behind things).Well worth the money."",""Reviewed in the United States on September 25, 2019""";;;;;;;;;

"1700,""This product originally was exactly what I was looking for: it was efficient, effective, and good for every day cleaning. I also picked it up during a nice winter sale which sweetened the deal even more. For a young couple without kids or pets, it was a good fit.However, it wasn't long before I found myself growing frustrated with it: in areas in which it had previously navigated without issue, it started to get lost and stuck and beep noisily at me in confusion. I used to be able to let it run while I was out of the house and it could easily navigate rooms and between hardwood and carpeted surfaces, but it became commonplace to find it stuck under chairs, desks, beds, really any furniture at all.The final straw was when I started to notice that my little Deebot would only run for about ten seconds before it would stop completely and complain that it had encountered an obstacle, but without one in sight. It turns out this is a common issue: a brush malfunction of any sort will stop this vacuum dead in its tracks. It will plant itself down and adamantly refuse to work after ten whole seconds.Mind you, I've only had the Deebot for a year"; 16 months to be exact. I did not expect it would simply give out on me after a year's time. And of course, it would give up after the one year warranty expired.I get it: robot vacuums are expensive pieces of machinery and software. To get one at a good deal, you have to expect cost cutting measures somewhere. But I'm disappointed in its longevity;" why does a single brush malfunction shut it down completely?Bottom line: if you want something that will work well for a time and you don't have a great deal of furniture, this is a nice find during a sale.

I am not the world's keenest house cleaner";" your expectations may be more rigorous.I did have a period where I could not get the Deebot to run. When I examined it closely, I saw that the bumper was stuck beneath a small tab. This made it inflexible, and since the bumper is its essential sensing tool, it could not run that way. I popped the bumper back above the tab. It ran fine after that. I think I displaced the bumper by picking up the unit one handed from the front. Now I lift it with both hands from behind.The Deebot operates randomly, but left to its own devices, it will do thorough job of vacuuming. It excels at getting pet hair from the edges of carpeting. Nice people live with their floors Deebot-ready, but I have to spend a few minutes patroling the area before vacuuming. Move or block areas with electrical cords, pick up large debris, pet toys and whatnot. Shut doors or block hallways to keep Deebot out. Then put your feet up with a good book while Deebot does your work for you.You should expect to empty the small dust bin a couple times in the course of an hour in very dusty rooms. If you run it regularly, you will only need to empty it at the end of its cycle.Buy it on sale. It is a fine household tool for the money."",""Reviewed in the United States on September 15, 2019""";;;;;;;;

"1726,""This robot vacuum is amazing. I was amazed at the efficiency the N79S delivered. I was nervous at first whether or not it would clean the whole room, but after leaving and coming back, it was apparent that no spot was missed. Be aware that battery time will be affected by the floor. Thicker carpet may drain the battery in about 45 minutes, whereas, hard floors will do the expected time or more. I would also recommend getting a kitchen mat to put the charger on otherwise the deebot will not properly dock. Truth be told, after emptying the bin, I was surprised to see how much it picked up that my regular vacuum didn't. This robot vacuum delivers both in quality and price. Definitely not a 4 star vacuum but rather a 5 star."",""Reviewed in the United States on September 15, 2019""";;;;;;;;;

"1732,""After comparing dozens of brands and models, I settled on this particular robot vacuum given the performance to price ratio reviews attributed to it. While this vacuum does a good job at picking up dirt, the programming is completely insane to the point of randomly zigzagging across a room with no logical pattern of any kind and no clearly organized way of covering the entirety of a room. Furthermore, I have found that it takes 10-15 minutes with suction turned off to find its dock and only succeeds in doing so about 30% of the time before it dies. Customer support says that moving the dock to another location can make a huge difference, however, I have tried placing mine where there is clear space around it of several feet and it still struggles by going into up to three other rooms before even finding the right room. Even when it does find the correct room, it will often leave it several times for others before eventually coming back.It's worth noting that while this is happening, it is in """"find dock"""" mode, so the vacuum function is effectively off, which makes it clear that it is simply incompetent, rather than actually cleaning more before returning.Update: I’ve had it for about six months now and the reason I kept it is that I placed about 38 pieces of tissue throughout the house. All were picked up over 1-2 runs. The randomness may be frustrating, but it works. I also received a partial refund for the inconvenience by someone who claims to be with amazon after-sale support, so I’ve improved the review for customer satisfaction purposes."",""Reviewed in the United States on September 14, 2019""";;;;;;;;;

Fortunately, it was under warranty and they replaced it.6-7 months later, I ran into the same issue with the side brush. At this point, it was out of warranty so I was told I was out of luck but they might be opening a repair center in the future.Overall, the quality was poor and the fact that they break so often seems dishonest.

My house is only 1200 sq ft. It used to go to all the rooms and even under the beds, now it just stays in the same room for 90 minutes! It seems it has developed a pattern and is no longer random. It still cleans that one room like a champ, but I’d really like for it to cover the whole area like it used to do."",""Reviewed in the United States on September 4, 2019""";;;;;;;;;
"1796,""It was awesome! We woke up every morning and the vacuum fairy had already been, the floors were spotless (although we called it Seamus... because its more like its being driven by a drunk leprechaun. There's an 80% chance it passed out in the middle of the floor before making back to the charger or got stuck under something).Then we changed our Wifi... which means it lost its connection to Alexa. The app is completely useless as far as re-configuring wifi, the only way to do it is to delete the bot and reinstall it as a new bot... and step 2 or 3 asks you to press a button on the remote. We always used Alexa, or relied on the preset schedule... we haven't seen the remote for years.Long story short, because we cant find the remote, we cant connect it to the new WiFi and it doesnt connect to Alexa, it's now useless. Loved it so much that we're looking into getting another one, another brand though, because its completely ridiculous that we have to buy a whole new vacuum because we cant find the remote."",""Reviewed in the United States on September 3, 2019""";;;;;;;;;

It's so nice to just come home to clean floors everyday.

While that was nice, I didn't notice what was actually going on. Now that I work from home, I can see that it slams into my dining table and chairs and it makes me CRINGE. It's good about avoiding walls but it can't sense thin, standing objects like chair legs, and it goes full-speed into them.

I have a large room with kitchen in an open floor plan and battery is gone after two rounds of periphery cleaning. I don't know if entire room is cleaned in one go because there's no map feature to show what area was cleaned. iPhone app is very basic. I do have to walk around and close bathroom doors, remove area rugs otherwise robot gets stuck. If I select a single room/area clean setting, there's no way to keep in one area, it wanders off. Another drawback - it gets stuck under bar stools and may take 1-2+ minutes to get out of the bar stool. I see the robot take small angle turns and try to get out but right when it is about to be free, it will take a larger angle turn, get stuck and then repeat the cycle all over again.

We have two dogs, one being an American Eskimo that leaves his fluffy fur around the house and other dog is a Morkie which she doesn't shed much. I have it programmed to run at 9 am daily and it does a great job on our 950 sq ft home. It goes over our one transition and avoids the steps without a problem. Since this level is all vinyl - it runs over 2 hours before it returns to its base. We empty the container everyday and it always has stuff in it - mostly the white fluffy fur. The only thing I don't like about it is that it bumps into my side tables (which are fairly light) and moves them a bit, so every day I have to straighten them out. We are going to try and add some small weights to the table in hopes that will help. Also, we have a recliner that plugs in - it gets hung up on the cord, which is a bummer. I just have made it a habit every morning to empty the container, unplug the recliner and put our two end tables up before I leave for the day and then put them back when I am home. This is the only reason why I gave it four stars - it would be perfect five stars if I didn't have to move these few items.

"1864,""I don’t know why I waited so long to get a robotic vacuum. I love it. At first it lagged a bit to find its way back to charger but after a couple of times it resolves."",""Reviewed in the United States on August 24, 2019""";;;;;;;;;
"1865,""The Ecovacs Deebot N79S has had its ups and downs with us over the 15 months we have owned it. Overall, we are extremely unhappy with this purchase. We bought the product in June of 2018. By August of 2019, it now sits as a floor decoration, unable to be used. As we are outside of our warranty window by 3 months, there is nothing that Ecovacs can do to help us resolve the issue. Now don't get me wrong, I am not expecting to be the exception to the warranty rules - our warranty expired, and that is that. What is frustrating is that 3 months after our warranty expired, a product we spent $250 on is now unusable. That is, in my opinion, unacceptable.Our main problem with the robot is that after 15 months, it will not run for more than 5 minutes before stopping, in the middle of the room, displaying a """"Main Brush Malfunction"""" on the app. I have replaced the main brush, the filters, and the side brushes, I have reset the robot, and I have tried removing the main brush to see if it runs without it, all with no luck - the robot continues to only run for 5 minutes before displaying the error, telling me that it is probably not the main brush that is problematic but something else entirely. The app does not provide a clear understanding of what that error is, leaving me helpless when trying to diagnose the problem. I contacted Ecovacs Customer Service, where after I told them everything I did (i.e. replace, remove and reset), they asked me to the EXACT same things, multiple times as their customer service apparently does not communicate between their representatives. One asked me to remove the main brush, and then two replies later, with two other representatives, I'm told to remove the brush again.... Their solution at the end of the day was, """"Sorry - you are out of warranty, there is nothing we can do"""". I have no problem paying to get it fixed, but it would be nice if their Customer Service could do a better job helping me diagnose the problem. Sure, they said I could wait until their repair shop center was open, but they didn't give me any idea of when that could happen. So now I sit with a robot that does not work.Pros:- When it worked, it worked great. The variable suction (controllable from the app) was fantastic. It did a good job cleaning the room it was in.- Customer services replied promptly and was helpful (enough). See below for additional.Cons:- Rarely would we be able to run the Deebot without some malfunction. Whether it is that the robot got stuck under a piece of furniture, or it went off a rug at just the right angle that the drop sensor malfunctioned, rarely would it actually make it back to the docking station without help. I think this is one of the biggest complaints that we have about this Deebot. I should not have to """"robot"""" proof my home for the robot to function. A rug should not cause the robot to malfunction. And either it needs to be a little taller or a little smaller so that it does not get stuck under regular furniture.- Errors on the app were unspecific and hard to track down. A """"main brush malfunction"""" was actually something completely different and untraceable.- Customer service, though responsive, was not super great. I submitted a complaint online, received a response in a timely fashion, replied, and received a response from a completely different person, asking the same questions I had just answered. This happened regularly. I received questions that I had already answered, being bounced from person to person until I was told that I was basically out of luck.- The robot also had a bunch of issues getting stuck in the same room, or going back to the same area over and over and over again. Now I understand this is not a human and thus has no inclination of what room it is in. But it regularly would be turning circles in our halfway, going back and forth, over and over again. It would be nice if it could recognize that it has spent 30 minutes in the same area, and track the wall to get out of the room.- There was inconsistency with the wall sensors. There were times that it would slowly approach the wall, before stopping and turning around. Then there were times when it would full on plow into the wall, slamming hard, and then turning around. Luckily, it never damaged the wall, but the inconsistency seemed a bit odd.Overall, we would not recommend this product to anyone. For the $250 price tag, it its a piece of junk. The ONLY reason I give it 1 star is that it did work for about a year before it became a wonderful room decoration."",""Reviewed in the United States on August 24, 2019""";;;;;;;;;

I had a battery issue from the start. It ran a good 2 hours on standard vac vs max.I started to notice it started to lose 5 then 10 and eventually 20 min over time.I broke and injured my toe in late July. I ran the Ecovac everyday along with my Roomba in approximately 1200 sq ft of hardwood and tile.I've bought replacement parts and always clean the vacuum after it runs.Two weeks ago I pushed the button for the vacuum to run and it would go about 1-2 feet and beep red. After troubleshooting it myself I called customer support.They led me through a few steps and then advised me to take a few pictures, attach my original invoice and address.They sent me a return label to drop off at a local UPS store. I had to provide a box and return everything including the base charger and remote.I emailed them everyday after I dropped it off. It took about 8 business days to receive a brand new vacuum.It was in a brand new box and packaged the exact same way when I originally ordered it.I saw a deal for this vacuum yesterday and contemplated buying one or two additional Ecovac's for convenience.I emailed CS this morning to double check the warranty.They said my warranty is exactly a year from the original date of purchase.My iRobot Roomba is 7 years old.

First off, it has a hard time getting over the tiny little incline to get into my bathroom that both of my old robot vacuums were able to handle with ease. I have to manually put it in there, which obviously is an issue if I'm not home when it's in use. I can, however, overlook that, as it's just a small part of my apartment.My real issue is that it is again banging into everything (doors, walls, furniture, etc). I've had it for  only a little over six months and have replaced it once already for this. It seems to work fine for two or three months, then the issues come back. The first time it started happening, they recommended I give it a full clean and use car headlight cleaner on the sensor. That worked for a day or two, then the problems persisted. I tried it again this time, and the issues have only gotten worse.Robot vacuums should not have these issues, especially after only a few months. I only run it twice a week, and clean the tray after every use.Again, I really wanted to like this vacuum, but that's proven more and more difficult.

But after about 2 months, I started getting a 'Main Brush Malfunction' error.  I had always kept the brush and bin clean.  But the main brush would no longer turn.  I called the company and after some tests, they replaced it with this model, the N79S. It was great.  I ran it most every day because I have two cats. Yes, it would get stuck sometimes under furniture but I'd just put it up and then it ran fine the next day.  One thing to note: if the battery runs down completely, you will have to set up the schedule again in the app.  But here it is about 14 months later and I'm getting the 'Main Brush Malfunction' error on this one.  As always, the brush is clean but it will barely turn.  Obviously I am out of the warranty now.  The Deebot will only run for a minute before the dreaded beeps start and it's done.  Maybe this happens if you run it almost every day like I do.  I don't know what else I could have done to prevent it at.  Right now I'm using my 10 year old Roomba until I can decide what to replace the Deebot with.  I'm wary to try another Deebot now that I've had two models with the same issue."",""Reviewed in the United States on August 5, 2019""";;;;;;;;;

"1997,""Bought this Sept of 2018.  It's Aug of 2019 now and I'm fed up with this device.The Good:- It picks up dog hair and generally has a lot of suction.- Easy to clean and even fix.- After a year of daily use, the battery is still strong.- Works just fine with Alexa.The Bad:- It constantly gets stuck.  I swear that sometimes it comes off it's base and goes directly to a """"sticking point"""" immediately almost as though it has a will of it's own and wants to make me mad.  By sticking-point, I mean under the corners of a couch or easy chair.  We have Living room couches that are just a little too low in the back for the bot, it will get stuck under these every time.  So we have to keep the bot out of the living room altogether.  To accomplish this, I've had to put 2X4 wood across two door ways to turn away the bot.  So every night or early morning, we have to move these into place... tired of that.- This sticking problem makes it so that it almost never completes its cycle.  I mean maybe once out of 30 times.  In fact when it does, my wife and I are surprised.- It's kind of loud- Just lately, it seems to have gotten aggressive.  Now it pushes the wood out of the way and goes and gets stuck in the living room.- We purchased new rugs and they have large geometric patterns of color.  The bot now gets stuck on the black swipes!  Must be some kind of light sensor, but now it gets stuck in the middle of the rug.Bottom line - I feel we have changed our life and habits too much to accommodate something that is supposed to make life easier and is also supposed to operate on it's own.  The failure rate is just too high. I don't like the disappointment of technology getting me frustrated first thing in the morning... every morning.  We are going to try another manufacturer's product that has """"boundaries"""" and """"invisible walls"""" accomplished with magnetic strip and hope for the best."",""Reviewed in the United States on August 4, 2019""";;;;;;;;;
