"5","We've had Deebot for just over a year and a half. We don't use it as much as some people - it's more of a supplement for us when we don't feel like getting out the Kirby, so it gets run about 2-3 times a month at most. Otherwise it always lives in its cradle.About two months ago it stopped working. That is - it would run for a few minutes, then start beeping four beeps with a red light. Doing extensive internet research suggested that Deebot needed a good deep cleaning and possibly a new battery. I followed multiple videos to clean all the hair out of every wheel, nook, and cranny that existed, but still the same. So we shelled out the $25 for a new battery.And today I tried to run it for the first time after the new battery has been charging for several days... and once again, it went for a few minutes, stopped in the middle of the room not near anything, and started the four beeps.So I guess, if you shell out hundreds of dollars for this thing, be sure to understand that it is a ""disposable"" product that will only last about 16 months, and then will be completely broken beyond repair, even if you follow the company's instructions and shell out additional money for a battery.","Reviewed in the United States on September 23, 2020"
"6","For those that don't want to read the entire report. DO NOT BUY if you intend on keeping it for a long-term use.I bought this Deebot 2 years ago, and finally decided to give it a review. For the first 9 months, the Deebot worked decently well for a family home and a shedding dog. We constantly cleaned it out after every use, which is expected since we ran it 3 times a week. We did have to slightly rearrange the house everytime since it does not have the capability to avoid most minor obstacles. Overall, we were pleased with the Deebot.Here is were it started to get frustrating as time went by. By 10 months it started having issues with the battery life and software. Imagine it cleaning a 1,500 sq ft area and then, dropping down to 750 sq ft area before it was triggerd it to find the charging port due to a low battery. This, from our observations, was a sharp decline in battery life. It was nearly an instant occurrence where it had issues cleaning.We replaced and cleaned the deebot accessories when needed or recommended by the app associated with the Deebot.By the 11th month, the software started to have issues. It would blink various stages of red and cease to clean. This is when we called customer service to get a replacement. We followed various cleaning and troubleshooting instructions before they decided to replace it. Nothing out of the ordinary for companies to do. However, we had to send in the old Deebot before receiving a replacement. Once it was sent, it took a number of weeks to recieve the replacement.They sent us a refurbished Deebot as a replacement and we immediately had issues with the Deebots software. It would randomly blink red and beep when charging (generally within the first 10 minutes of charging), try to go over obstacles rather than avoid them, and still had battery half-life battery. It was as if, they decided to give me a replacement of my old one with additional issues. Granted, it did clean the area until the battery was low this time. When we called, it was too late! We were over the 12 month warranty and all they could do, or want to do, was buy a new one or we had to pay to get it fixed. Low and behold, we stuck with it for a year with all it's issues to at least use it until it is ready to be in the grave.We are now in the market to buy another vaccum. They have been a lifesaver when it comes to sweeping hairs and miscellaneous nonsense. Plus, I feel it does a better job sweeping than myself.Nevertheless, having a robo-vaccum has been a 1st world saver for reducing time and ensure a decent clean. Would I get a Deebot again... NO I wouldn't. This time I am looking for quality product and a company that will stand behind it with more than just a one year warranty.Why???Because I take care of my stuff with the expectation that it will last for years. This obviously does not possess qualities that will last.FYI, the 2 deebots we have had have normal wear and tear from bouncing of objects and what have you. They were not abused, damaged, or tinkered with. However, a few nights ago the Deebot decided to force its way through an area that has a lip under the dishwasher. When I mean forced, it used all its might and power to get under there. It wasn't until I went in the Kitchen because I heard it in the kitchen longer than it normally does. When I pulled it out, trying to inflict the least damage to the device and appliance, the result is in the picture.","Reviewed in the United States on September 23, 2020"

Quick, painless, and easy.So why the 1 star rating you ask? Well, well, well. Where do I begin after that?The problems: The machine will not connect to the app. Never has, never will.It is so out of wack it turns on in the middle of the night waking me up.It barely works on a repeated cycle like its supposed too.It doesn't go to any other rooms other than my living room.It stopped working completely. I've gotten in touch with the manufacturer because my extended warranty has not picked up yet until the manufacturer is done. They have been an ABSOLUTE NIGHTMARE. They are the least helpful people in the world. I am supposed to be out of a machine for who knows how long. They insist I ship it back to China for it to be worked on and if it can't be fixed they will send me a refurbished one. I've requested a replacement in the meantime...this has been going on since January. I still have not been able to send my machine back.I would have rather spent the extra money getting a more reputable company that doesn't let their customers go through a grace period of 9 months without a working machine. I also am infuriated I bought an extended warranty on a product that I cannot utilize it on. Save up more money and buy from a better company. Because trust me the back and forth talk of fixing my machine has been awful and I am so busy I got this thinking that it would save me time vacuuming. It has not saved me anytime doing anything.","Reviewed in the United States on September 22, 2020"

But now that it works it has a ""main brush malfunction"" every 5-10 seconds.

Mr Sucky was (and still is) doing such a fantastic job we just threw the vacuum away, and have not missed it once. He runs every night while we sleep. Occasionally, we will stick him in a room to clean. You do have to preclean the floor so there is nothing he will run over and get stuck in (he has vacuumed countless socks from our 3 Y/O, as well as legos, and other stuff so always check his dustbin before emptying!) Change the brushes often (~3-6 months, They are CHEAP on Amazon), and you will be happy! We did change the battery at about ~15 months, but honestly Mr. Sucky for how much value we have got from him has been very maintenance free.

It really keeps fine particles from getting through. I purchased this vacuum because my wife had really wanted on since we moved in to our home. There were several much more expensive units but this one really gets the job done. I first used it right after a deep clean full size vacuum run and noticed this still picked up a whole lot of things the other vacuum did not.

"30","I liked this vacuum for the first year. It did a great job at keeping the cat hair and litter dust to a manageable level. Where this vacuum fails is in longevity. We bought this vacuum two years ago. The first year it ran daily just fine. Then we moved to a different apartment where we had to monitor it a lot because it was getting stuck on everything (not the vacuums fault, just a poor layout). So we hardly used it the second year. Now we are in a perfect apartment for it, but it seems to be having both a battery and a brush motor problem. We keep getting this 4 beep error when it's done charging (Google it, it's a common problem with no solid solution), and I've been having to take it apart once a week to clean tiny strands of hair and dust from the main brush motor because we keep getting a 4 beep error when it is running (cleaning the motor stops the error for about a week).After a lot of googling and reading endless twitter chains where the customer support refused to confirm whether any solutions were available, I finally emailed support and asked for a solution. They absolutely refuse to tell me whether replacing the battery will help, or if there are any troubleshooting options. They claim that replacing the battery is a safety issue. It really isn't. The battery is clearly designed to be user replaceable and they sell them on Amazon, but support refused to say whether that might help or not. They did give me a link to their ""partner"" company that can repair the vacuum.These issues seem to be common across their whole line of vacuums, so I would advise avoiding this company all together.","Reviewed in the United States on September 10, 2020"
"31","I didn’t buy it from Amazon but I figured I post a review here since it would get a lot more views.  Soooo.. what do I think about this vacuum?  Well, It does a good job vacuuming.. it picks up quite a bit of dirt and hair every single time it goes out but this thing is as dumb as it gets.. it roams aimlessly thru the house.. like there is zero intelligent path that will result in an effective cleaning, so you will have random spots missed all over the house and If you have couches that are barely high enough for the robot to get under you can 100% count on it getting stuck.. and trust me.. it will happen often.  Lastly.. this robot is so dumb that it will literally take 15-20 mins to find the charging station (even if it is in the middle of a wide open living room) and 8 out of 10 times it won’t find it so you will have to go on a hunt for the robot all over the house wherever it died and pick it up to put it in the charging station.. other than that it is great for the price.","Reviewed in the United States on September 9, 2020"

Hopefully the repaired vacuum will last much longer. If we have any issue after 4 months from now, we’ll be on our own.While Ecovac’s customer service is appreciated, I would recommend another manufacturer to a prospective buyer.

"52","I purchased this vacuum based on reviews on Amazon and elsewhere. The first year was fine, though we never converted to the truly robot vacuum lifestyle. We would use it a couple of times a week and drop it in the kids room and shut the door while it did its thing. Near the 1 year anniversary of owning, we started to use a bit more to clean. After 18 month or so, the vacuum started beeping. The vacuum turned into a smoke detector in the middle of the night that you would have to hide in the corner of the garage until you could find the batteries...unfortunately, batteries wouldn't fix this. I contacted ECOVACS customer service to start the troubleshooting process. Luckily, I purchased with a credit card that had an extended warranty. No problem, a few quick tests and I'm told that the issue is the battery. 9 months later...I now know it's not the battery and ECOVACS has finally troubleshot it to be something with the brush motor. 9 months later and now out of my credit card warranty. First, ECOVACS cannot communicate well with a customer. They wait days or weeks to respond, do not read previous conversation or have forgotten the issue by the time they respond, and don't seem to understand their own vacuums. They troubleshot my issue wrong with multiple people on multiple occasions and will sometimes promise to help and other times tell you to use the 3rd party repair shop that they have no affiliation with...sure. Now, I end up with a vacuum that works okay but once fully charged beeps incessantly. I would donate the thing, though I don't wish it on anyone. So instead, it gets recycled and I never buy from ECOVACS again.

"62","The Deebot for the most part works. I didn't realize what random floor cleaning ment  because I had an older vacuum bot that mapped the areas. This one goes straight until it bumps into something and then makes a slight right turn until it bumps into something and then may go right or left. It goes until the battery is dead, not until your room is clean. In fact, it might miss parts of your room. The FAQ's day to run the Bot more often to get more areas. The bin is good for 1 run only maybe 2 if you do it frequently, that was not like my old one also. But my real frustration is the APP and connection related to CUSTOMER SERVICE. For some reason, my home Wifi can control every appliance except this one. The APP won't connect to the bot and therefor I can't use all the features like Google Home starting or HIGH Suction (that feature is not on the physical remote). I have been back and forth with Megan Finnerty of support providing the same info over and over. They told me they would escalate the issue and I've yet to be contacted. This is now a 2 month issue. I have provided Port information that my provider blocks but for some reason, ECOVACS will not tell me the answer. They want to send me a new one but the whole thing works if connected to my phone hotspot, so it's not the device. It needs an advance tech person to answer info on ports. If you buy it for Home Automation support like I did, it's 50/50 it will work for you.","Reviewed in the United States on August 27, 2020"

However, in the last 3 months, I have had to send to vacuum out two times, and I'm waiting to receive the tracking for the third time. The unit has actually not been repaired, and straight out of the box, from their engineers, it has the same issue. Customer service has been evasive. They say they will get back with you quickly, then 3 days pass and they have no reason for not contacting you.So, if you like to have a robot vacuum that spends more time in transit being ""fixed,"" and  having to constantly call and go through the same steps multiple times to try and get a working unit, then this is the one for you. If you'd like a vacuum that actually works, I'd recommend a different brand.","Reviewed in the United States on August 25, 2020"

The problem with this vacuum cleaner is that the motor inside, the one that moves the main brush, get dust and hair inside and it make it get stuck and the vacuum stops cleaning telling you that the main brush is malfunctioning. At first I though that it was the main brush itself, so I bough a new one and replaced it. But that wasn't the issue. After a few weeks not working, I decide to do google search and found a video of a guy that opened the device and cleaned the motor inside, and that did the work for him. I tried two times, removed all the dust and hair inside, lubed the shaft, and the motor is now running smoothly, but the vacuum keep stopping and telling that the main brush is malfunctioning. I have a cat and I need it to keep the house clean. I had it scheduled to clean twice a day, and now, after trying to fix it and buying replacement parts, I will have to buy another one.If you decide to buy this one, please, make sure to open it at least once every 4 months to clean the inside motor. If not, it won't last much. And the beep when it stops is annoying af. It keeps beeping once every few minutes even when charging. Annoying af. Doesn't clean and annoys me.

"76","I have bought three of these Deebots. One was for my house and we liked it so much that we bought my mom and my wife's mo one too.This is great for cleaning up after dinner when everything falls under the dinner table. It takes some time to get around all the table and chair legs but it cleans everything up good.We usually run it in our living room, dining room, and hallway once every couple of days. Sometimes we turn it on before we leave the house and when we get home it's vacuumed about 95% of the rooms we let it into. Most of the time we find it back in its charger but there's been a couple of times it couldn't find it's way back and the battery dies. That's only happened 3 times. Usually, it gets stuck under the dining room table cause it can't get around all the legs.Our cleaning day is on Saturday morning. We put this in each room and close the door. After 10 min it's all done. We have rabbits so every couple of nights we let it run in the living room and it picks up a lot of fur. The suction is very strong cause I've found legos, pens, pencils, and markers when I empty it out.The dust collector is small but if you don't have pets, you can probably run it 3 -4 times before you have to empty it out. We empty it out about 3 times a week.This easily goes from wood floor to carpet or rug very easily. It moves big things out of the way. Sometimes it takes a while but it can pretty much figure out how to get around things.There are a lot of more expensive ones out there that remember the walls and furniture in your room and do crazy stuff but for the price, this thing is worth it.The remote lets you drive it around, auto vacuum, and send it back home. There's an app that lets you do the same thing as the remote but you can also tell it to start or go back home from where ever you are. The set up to get it connected to your wifi is super easy.My rabbits use to be scared of this but now they follow it around or just lay and watch it. Sometimes it bumps into the and they know its just gonna turn around and go awayOne thing I didn't like which has only happened a couple of times is when the power goes in and out, the vacuum just starts going for a few minutes then goes back home.Eventually, I might go and grab Ecovacs newer models that do a few more things and do a review on that. but until then, my family love the ones that we have. I recommend this vacuum for anyone who doesn't want to spend over $200 on a robot vacuum but still wants a great product","Reviewed in the United States on August 22, 2020"
"77","I have purchased three of these units and I won't be purchasing again.  My first one dies when it was 14 months old - mind you we were lucky to run this twice a week It decided it was not going to take / hold a charge.  EcoVacs customer service told me I was out of luck AND they did not even have a repair service at that time but one would be available soon.  I placed in in the closet and ordered another unit thinking we'd give the old one to a family member after EcoVacs got their repair going.  The second one is not approximately 10 months old and the unit will not charge at the dock - I can plug it in and it charges fine.  EcoVacs solution is for me to PURCHASE a new dock despite being within my warranty period.  Not a good solution and I won't be purchasing a dock.On the third unit - I bought for my mother-in-law.  She used it a lot but bottom line was it lasted long enough for the warranty to expire and was dead.Ecovacs repair was expensive - over charged for repairs and shipping - almost the price of new.  That unit is still working -Bottom line - three dead units and 1 expensive repair in approx 18 month and not like we abused them - I have hardwood floors and NO pets indoors.

"84","The Good:-the basic cleaning and suction functions are good-it is not that noisy when running-pics up a lot of pet hairThe Bad:-terrible application- FIX THE SCHEDULING ISSUES!!!!!!! The app should ALWAYS override any other setting on the actual vacuum. Currently, I have 3 ghost vacuums waking me up in the middle of the night. Yes, I know the solution is to reset it but I'm quite annoyed by this being the 3rd time I do it. What caused the scheduling to unsync from the app? Power loss, phone reset, and mystery schedule that was overridden by the wrong timezone at some point.-THE BEEPS- If you make a ""dumb"" vacuum, (random as you call it) designed for small spaces, WHY on earthy would you make it beep for 20 minutes if it get stuck!?! 3 loud beeps should be more than enough. I can't always go save its life every time it eats a show and it just ends up beeing for about half the morning because it simply won't shut up. This is perhaps the MOST annoying feature of this device. Even worse, this isn't customizable! It just beeps and beeps and beeps super loud for super long. FIX THIS.-Too dumb- the bump sensors are sometimes TOO sensitive and sometimes TOO aloof. Example- one of the biggest issues I have is a small tall shag carpet. Sometimes, It will detect the shag and move away- good ecovac. Other times, it will give 0 Fs and ram straight through the vacuum pushing the bump guard and continuing like a valiant soldier through a battlefield. Then, begins the issue with the beeping.-The remote- I like the remote, but it's stupid to have a remote a lot of users will misplace after a few months OVERRIDE the settings you've created on the app. Why is it so difficult to add a button to clear all the existing configs on the vacuum so that the APP settings are king on the ecovac?/endrantOverall, if just the beeping issue would be fixed I would not mind the other problems as much. But the beeping just drives me insane when I am in the middle of a conference call and the (relatively quiet vacuum) starts beeping it's wheels off.","Reviewed in the United States on August 19, 2020"

And lastly, the reviews where pretty much rave reviews. In the direction it tells you that you have to keep it about 3 feet clear in either side on the charging dock and with it having the low profile that it does I put the charging dock under my couch up against the wall so it’s out of the way and you can’t see it when it’s not in use, it’s a perfect spot for it!!!  I would down load the app for it as soon as you get the notification of delivery by Amazon so you have it and the app is called ECOVACS.  Very easy, and when you set it up you can name it anything. I gave it my bosses name! So when you set it up with Alexa I can now say, “Hey Alexa, tell (insert your bosses name) to clean my floor” and it starts and does a very good job.

After resetting her several times and performing all the maintenance and troubleshooting recommendations, it was obvious she had lost her mind. Ecovacs was very good about quickly honoring their warranty. After we sent her back in the original packaging with all of the parts, we received a new one (I don't believe it was refurbished). Unfortunately, this second model only worked for about 3 months and then it would just stop with a flashing error light and sit there beeping. After many resets and, again, performing all of the recommended actions to troubleshoot, it didn't help. This time when we contacted Ecovacs, they said that the warranty on the replacement unit only covered it one year from the date of the original Ecovacs purchase.

To have a good experience, start with clean floors and run this robot very often, like every time you leave the house.

I used to vacuum twice a week to keep my dog's hair from forming tumbleweeds, and now every time I leave the house I turn this guy on and come home to a bin full of dog hair and dust.No bells and whistles on this one, it pretty much just blindly bumps into stuff.

"114","Overall a good vacuum for light maintenance work.  A full charge will give it about 1-1.5 hrs of vacuum at low suction.  There is a max suction option, but we don't use it much as it's a little louder and low suction still fills the bin.  We have 1 dog, who has a medium shed.  This vacuum does a nice job cleaning up the hair.  It runs every day and the bin is always full when complete, so it definitely works.  It works very well on hard wood floors.  You need to install their app to set a schedule.  Not happy with the fact that I needed to register with the manufacturer to use the app.  The vacuum does get hung up a lot on small objects, but that may be the case for all of these robotic vacuums.My biggest complaint is that the vacuum struggles to find it's way home.  There are way too many times when I have to go looking for it because it gets lost and just gives up.  Sort of like when you're out binge drinking with the guys and wake up on a park bench the next morning, but don't remember how you got there.  This is why I'm knocking a star off.

"124","It accomplished the task for about 6 months.  Then it started deteriorating.  First the charge lasted shorter and shorter.  Then it started to pick up less and less dirt  Then it started charging just 30% of the time, which means, 70% of the time that I want to use it, I cannot because it is not charge.  At around the one year mark, I am hardly using it because it is so unreliable.  I consider it lucky if there is a charge when I want to use it and even when that happens, the charge lasts about 15 minutes.  I did buy extended warranty so filing a claim now.  The extended warranty insurers must know that in general, these vacuum robots (not just this brand but other brands too) don't last because the extended warranty are not cheap in relation to their price.  For about a $200 to $250 vacuum bot, they are charging about $35 for a 2 or 3 year warranty.","Reviewed in the United States on August 1, 2020"

When I called customer service to inquire about it they acted as if they had never heard of the problem I was having (4 beeps while on charging station) even though the issue is well documented on the internet. My only option according to them was to send it to a 3rd party repair service.

"136","I had such high hopes when I ordered this Deebot.  It does work on our bathroom tile floor, wood kitchen/hallway floor and the living room carpeting, but ... we have three open (no doors) points of entry in the living room so if I just want to vacuum in there I have to find something to block those points of entry.  It often gets stuck under one or two pieces of furniture so I have to find something to block those too.  It doesn't do well in corners and sometimes it has a difficult time finding its home base.  And it seems to keep going over the same area when in AUTO mode.  When I first got it, I experimented with setting the remote to have it automatically vacuum late at night.  Well now I can't get it to NOT run late at night.  I've contacted Ecovacs and they had me run a series of steps to ""reset"" the unit (turn it off for 5 seconds, turn it back on, press the Auto button until it beeps three times, then remove the batteries from the remote and put them back in) which I tried several times.  Then a different tech had me remove the plug from the charger and plug it directly into the unit which I did for a night (no further instructions beyond that) and the next night I returned the plug to the charger.  Still runs by itself at night.  I had been corresponding back and forth with two different techs via email until I finally asked how they would proceed since their fixes haven't worked.  Now they are ghosting me.  I haven't heard anything from them and of course, we are way beyond the return window with Amazon, although I WAS within that window when all our corresponding began.  So I guess I will use it as entertainment and go back to my regular vacuum cleaner for the actual work.  Maybe I will file a dispute with my credit card company ...","Reviewed in the United States on July 24, 2020"

After 4 months or so we started noticing that it began running in to things more often and getting stuck on our rugs.  We cleaned the Deebot but it never seemed to get any better.  Then one day it just started going in circles, it will back out of the charger and just go in circles.

If first cost $32.98 to send the device to them ($19.99 shipping plus  $12.99 for something else maybe insurance) although the diagnostic is supposed to be free.  I received my quote for repair for $59.99 to replace the N79 Series Main Brush Motor Assembly + $9.99 for the recommended but optional Ecovacs Cleaning of Sensors and Interior of Chassis MB + another $19.99 for return shipping.  Total cost to repair $122.95.  As of today this device is selling for $169.99.  So would I have been better off buying a new one or will this repair extend the life of the device?  Chicago Tribune lists as of Aug 2020 the eufy RoboVac L70 as its best pick which Amazon sells for $499.  If I purchase a replacement, whenever that might be, I will look for a device that has a longer warranty, at least 2 years to get past that hazardous 18 month hurdle.I had my deebot for about 18 months and loved it.  I have 3 cats and it did a great job of picking up cat hair.  Then, about 6 month after the warranty ended it started to stop about 5 minutes after starting with ""4 beeps"" and displayed a ""Main brush malfunction"" in the app.  I cleaned the brush, following the instructions provided and I continued to get the 4 beeps.  I ordered a replacement kit of brushes (including a new main brush) and filter.  After replacing those I continued to get the 4 beeps.  I followed a YouTube video ""Ecovacs Deebot N79 Main Brush Error Fix - Four Beeps"" (which takes at least 45 minutes) and after reassembly I continued to get the 4 beeps ""Main brush malfunction"".

And now it stops and plays it's ""help me, something's wrong"" noise every five to ten minutes in the middle of the floor (nothing's actually wrong with it).

When approaching a wall, instead of slowing down and lightly nudging the wall before heading off in a different direction, it pivots a few inches before the wall. It IS able to run alongside the wall and get the baseboard area, but it has to approach that position in a specific way.I also have trouble getting it to leave the room where the docking station is. The main level of my house has 5 rooms plus a small hallway, but it stays mostly in the office where the charger is plugged in. I sometimes have to create barriers to keep it from going back repeatedly.Lastly, it’s not great on carpet. It would probably do fine on very low pile like you would find in an office building, etc. but the one room I have that’s carpeted is pretty standard plush, and it doesn’t do the best job in there. My old roomba was great on any surface. I wish, in hindsight, that I’d just coughed up the extra hundred and bought a refurbished one.

"177","Absolute time saver! Excellent for cleaning dog hair on hard surfaces. With 3 dogs, it runs every day. Much quieter than a normal vacuume. I run it on the programed Edge cleaning and it gets all the hair in the perimeter.Works great with Alexa, just say, ""Alexa, tell DEBOT to clean"", and it immediately launches from it's dock and does an auto clean (random pattern).Does an ok job on medium height carpet.Great job under tables, around chairs, and under beds.Now the not so good.... After about 5 months it started bumping into everything. Troubleshooting said to clean the front sensor and helped a bit. The front lense cover seems to get scratched easily.I polished it with lens scratch remover/cleaner, and it helped a lot but still doesn't last long. It still does it's job but bumps into everything to do it. A little annoying, but not terrible.But now it always gets stuck under my rocking reclining chair, then that's it for the day if I don't find it sooner and put it back into motion.It needs to be emptied every day or two since I have 3 dogs.So, for the most part, it is a priceless investment if you have shedding pets and hard floors.","Reviewed in the United States on July 4, 2020"

"183","This vacuum was pretty good for the first 4 months that we had it. However, it struggled with our low-pile carpet and it constantly got stuck in our chair legs at our dining room table. We decided to relocate it to our highest-traffic area; our tiled Florida room between our family room and backyard. For the first month, it did pretty well. It was good at cleaning up dirt and debris tracked in by our feet and our (small, nonshedding) dogs. But lately, the sensor for detecting obstructions is completely shot. It bangs into walls. It gets stuck under our couch (I’m not sure why it’s trying to push under the couch if the couch is too low). It can’t figure out how to get back to it’s charging dock before the battery runs out. I’ve even replaced the rechargeable battery once (which was also pretty expensive). Overall, I’m not very happy with this purchase. For as expensive as it is, it should work better for longer. It does a good job of “cleanup” with the debris still (when it is working), but it is no longer “convenient” when I have to go look for it every morning and—which usually involves lifting my couch and manually moving it to its charger. Next time, I think I will buy an iRobot instead.","Reviewed in the United States on July 2, 2020"

"197","Update - two years inI would definitely give the Deebot five stars if reliable. Unfortunately, after two years it became erratic and began to intermittently malfunction. Deebot tech support was awful. They simply advise that you send the unit to Ifixrobot. Other than routine wear items like batteries and brushes, absolutely no repair parts are available for purchase. I needed a specific repair part that looked like it should cost $10 max, but was advised that this part was not sold. We have owned Roombas in the past and there is huge availability of repair parts. On Deebot, parts availability is zilch and tech support is zero as well. If you consider this as a two-year disposable item, it's fine. As a longer-term vacuum solution, look elsewhere.Original review: We spend six weeks each year at a campground at the beach. Try as you might, it's impossible not to track in a bit of sand as you re-enter the camper from the beach. We found the Deebot N79S to be the perfect solution. We'll run the Deebot several times each day and it does an amazing job of removing sand from every nook and cranny of the camper. We always start the Deebot as we head to the beach and upon return, it has cleaned the camper floor, successfully re-docked/recharged and is ready to go again. It has great suction and has been 100% reliable.","Reviewed in the United States on June 26, 2020"

"222","Before I delve into the real reason for my 1 star rating (the product didn't last), I wanted to mention that one of the reasons I chose this model was that it was advertised to work with Amazon Alexa.  We never could get it working with her, and, as I recall, it had something to do with the type or speed of WiFi we have (some numbers I don't recall), so if that's a feature you're looking for on any type of robot vacuum, I suggest you carefully look into making sure it will be compatible with your specific type of WiFi.  We don't have any special kind of WiFi or Internet - just one of the standard choices from Comcast - so I was surprised.Now, for why I cannot recommend this specific robot vacuum: I understand it may seem strange to give 5 stars for all of the individual categories, but a 1 star overall.  The reason is that when it worked, it was great, but it only worked for about 14 months.  Then, inexplicably, it just stopped, and it was just 2 months after our 1-year warranty period had ended.  It would wander briefly away from the base, beep at us, flash red, and then we'd have to carry it back to the base even though it was fully charged.  As a family of 5, with 3 kids under the age of 7 when we purchased the robot vacuum, I really thought a machine like this would simplify my life, but didn't have the budget for the more reputable brand.  I throughly researched these items through customer reviews and consumer advocate magazines/websites, which lead me to choose this particular brand/item, so I was very disappointed when it proved to be unreliable.I did contact customer service to see if they would make an exception on the warranty, since it was so close to its expiration.  While they were great at sending us timely troubleshooting tips to see if we could figure out the problem, it ended up being something that would cost almost as much to repair as to purchase a whole new one and they would not cover it because the warranty period was over.  For an item at this price point, I wouldn't expect it to last forever, but definitely a few years.  It's also important to note that we were very careful that our children weren't rough with it - we did NOT put the baby on it for rides like you see in many funny home videos.Something more to consider: After it died, I thought I would really miss being able to push a button and relax as my floors were vacuumed, but I ended up with a popular brand of cordless, folding stick vacuum for the same price, which I now prefer.  I don't miss tripping over the vacuum and base on the floor (there are specific requirements for where you can put the base so your vacuum doesn't get ""lost""/unable to find its way home, so it's not like you can just tuck it away in a corner).  My biggest messes would be around and under the dining table because my kids are very messy eaters (we must say ""hold over"" 20 times per meal and there's still half their meal on their chair and floor and all over the table), and this type of vacuum was not great for that area because of all the chairs and table legs interfering with its path.  The stick vacuum I got also easily disassembles into a hand vac, so I can get under the table and chairs easily with the full stick vacuum and then detach the hand vac to quickly clean off the chairs themselves (and sometimes I even vacuum the table before wiping it down).Another issue that might vary among brands and models is that after we lost power once in a storm, we discovered that when the power came back on, the robot would start itself back up and immediately start vacuuming.  We discovered this one night when we were being awakened by a beeping sound in the middle of the night because we have very high marble transitions that it sometimes got stuck on - thankfully that was the only issue created by the self-starting.  But, if you're like me and your floors aren't always ""picked up"" and free from miscellaneous children's toys or clothing (a sock here, a forgotten Barbie there), this could've been an even bigger problem when it turned itself on.  We don't currently have a pet, but we've also seen horror stories of pets that have had an accident on the floor & then the vacuum has spread (or flung) it all over the house - this could very well happen if the power flickered off and on in the night or while no one was home.  We learned we had to unplug it whenever we went away for the weekend or at night whenever there were storms in the forecast, which was kind of a pain.So, before you jump into the robot vacuum cleaner game, really think about what would truly work best for you and your family and whether a robot vacuum really is as convenient as it seems in the long run.","Reviewed in the United States on June 17, 2020"

Note, we had an issue with the battery after maybe a year and a half, but it was easy to replace and only cost about $20.Pros:- we vacuum twice a week and the dustbin is pretty full every time, so it definitely works.- we have one cat and it does a good job cleaning the hair from hardwood. We don’t let kitty go into the bedroom, which has carpet, so not sure how Deebot would fare there.- pretty quiet, though I wouldn’t watch TV with it on.- hasn’t had any major issue.- the “edge” setting works well for cleaning up debris that collects where the wall meets the floor, especially in the kitchen.Cons:- tends to get stuck where the floor isn’t smooth. For example, I’ve realized it has a hard time going over the divider between the living room and kitchen so it tends to vacuum the kitchen less. This means we sometimes have to manually place it in the kitchen to give it a good clean.- the replacement side brushes we’ve purchased have all been of pretty low quality (sheds, gets tangled, etc.).","Reviewed in the United States on June 14, 2020"

"253","This vacuum does not maintain cognizance of the settings you establish in the app. I have my time zone properly set. This vacuum tends to operate on days that I have not selected for scheduled cleaning. I first ran into the problem when it would begin a cleaning job on Sunday morning while the schedule was set to MTWThF, so I disabled Monday and it stopped cleaning on Sunday and Monday.  I disabled Friday because it randomly started cleaning on Saturday.  With my scheduled cleaning set to TWTh now, it still fires up randomly on Saturday this week.  I am going to terminate this vacuum robot.  For a while there, the app failed to remember my setting for more than a week or two.  I have owned this vacuum for a couple of years now and it’s not my favorite.  I had an iRobot for years before this one and I own Roborock 20 (excellent).

"264","I've got this AND the iRobot Roomba 690. I like this one so much better it has prompted me to review two years later.First off - the negative- this one gets stuck ALL the time in high pile carpet. It has such good suction that it cant help it.  It also is a ""little"" bit of a pain to empty. But it does SO much better, I'm willing to forgive.We had to replace our 1st Deebot due to some serious use - their customer service was nothing but great and easily sent us a NEW replacement. And our original had been a Warehouse item. Yes, the Roomba has broken a few times now (including it's charging base) and it's not as durable as you would think for the price. And they were a PAIN to get help with when it broke.The app allows for SO much more flexibility in scheduling cleaning times. Roomba is once a day, and that's it. No good if you have three indoor pets and tons of floor traffic.The Roomba cost more. The replacement parts cost more. The Roomba is much louder. And the talking errors? After a few years, you get absolutely sick of listening to it. ""Please charge Roomba"" ""Error. Please charge Roomba"". when it, again, could not find it's way home or when it's sitting on the dang charger! ugh.The Roomba does a LOUSY job of finding it's way home. We rarely have to find the Deebot. Every other day I am locating the Roomba and placing it on it's charger. I'm about done with it.The Deebot also vacuums MUCH longer and seems to pick up more.My FAVORITE feature on the Deebot is that it will reset itself on it's charger (and continue charging) if my dog accidentally bumps it off. It takes me a day or so to figure out the Roomba was accidentally moved, is not charged and won't be for hours. It has to be *just* right on the charger or no charge.I wanted to get the fancy expensive Roomba with the little trash bin, but the performance of this one totally killed that idea. Save your money, get the cheaper guy and clean that bin.","Reviewed in the United States on June 3, 2020"
"265","This vacuum was great while it worked.First the good - It did a great job getting into all nooks and crannies of the living room. It was effective on multiple surfaces (hardwood floor and a few rugs of different height).  The scheduling and smart home integration is also a great feature - being able to schedule it to run daily and turn it on/off with voice commands is very convenient.  The battery lasts long enough to thoroughly clean the ~800 sq ft of our second floor.Unfortunately, the Deebot has now malfunctioned and refuses to work.  I get a 'side brush malfunction' error and no amount of cleaning resolves it. Reading through the reviews, it seems like this is a pretty common error with no easy resolution. Also, because it stopped working just ONE WEEK outside of the warranty period, my only option is to spend more money to send it off for repairs and hope the repair cost is less than the cost of a new Deebot.The features and operation are great, but unfortunately I can't recommend buying this product as it just doesn't seem like Ecovacs' build quality is that great.","Reviewed in the United States on June 2, 2020"

Now it only will vacuum about 15 minutes before needing to be recharged.  This machine had basically an 11 month life.

"268","I will say, I LOVED this vacuum for the first 3 months. It’s nothing fancy, but it works great. We have a cat, and hard flooring, so hair balls would tend to collect between cleanings. It was great having DEEBOT to do a run every other day or so and just keep on top of the pet hair.  Only real downside to note is this model does not have any machine learning capabilities. Meaning it will not ‘learn’ your home and know if it’s missed any spots. Essentially it just bounces from wall to wall in a random pattern over and over and hopes it gets it all. Sounds annoying but didn’t bother us at all. Comes with a remote control so you can direct it to a specific spot if need be. Another feature I liked was that the filter was washable. It was very easy to keep the bin and wheels cleanIt transitioned from our hard flooring to our area rug fine enough, but would sometimes struggle on our low pile area rug.Vacuum stopped working completely after 3 months use. Right in the middle of Covid. It is now June and we are looking into trouble shooting/ repair options.According to the manual, the beeps and flashing we are getting are because the bin and wheels need to be cleaned. As you can see from my picture, they are immaculate. But it still won’t turn on and work.Amazon just connects you with manufacture’s service team, which was a pretty frustrating experience. They have a terrible phone connection and the call kept cutting in and out. I was told they would send an email with troubleshooting options, but they have not.I’m really disappointed in this product. I would have rather gotten a robotic vacuum from Costco and been protected by their year return policy.  Most vacuum repair shops we’ve reached out to don’t service robotic vacuums. We’re now out $200, at a time we really can’t afford to replace it.  It’s frustrating to have only gotten 3 months use out of it.I would advise spending a little more to get something either longer lasting, or from a company that has better service/repair/return options.","Reviewed in the United States on June 2, 2020"

I had a big carpet in the living room, another one in the kitchen and three carpet runners. The rest is ceramic tile.Rosita learned quickly her way to keep the whole apartment spotless. Sometimes we have a young couple with two kids visiting us and the apartment is left very dirty. Now it's not problem that they come more often because Rosita cleans everything really good.Also I had allergies because we live in a 10th floor and our balcony door is left open to get the island fresh air but lot of dust was coming inside too. Somehow there is lot's of lint too. Now my allergies are gone!We got a lot of entertainment sometimes because Rosita got rebelled and wants to go only one place but we carefully guide her putting boundaries so she clean everything faster and better. The battery last more when it happens. Every time I use Rosita I wash carefully the filters and put the bristles in hot water so they become straight again.

"288","I bought mine in Nov 2018.  For about a year, it worked really well.  I have one dog who has 2 seasons of heavy shedding per year.  I live in a one-level apartment with hard-wood floors and throw-rugs.  What I like about the Deebot:  It cleans under furniture so you don’t have to move heavy items.  If I deebot-proof a single room like my bedroom or bathroom, I can just shut the door and let it do the job and leave it alone.  It does a pretty thorough job and leaves the floor shiny if you run it long enough.  It doesn’t have the same power as a regular vacuum so it needs to go over the same spot a few times.  What I don’t like:  after the warranty ran out, it began failing.  It runs for about 3 minutes and then starts beeping with an error.  The error is described in the manual as a sensor error and it says to clean the sensor but cleaning it doesn’t help.  I bought all new brushes and rollers and filters for it, it worked great for 1 day and then started w the beeping again.  Things to consider if you purchase:  you need to make sure that there are no electrical cords lying on the floor because you may walk into the room and find the deebot dragging your lamp around by the cord.  I put my cords in a shoe box because the deebot just thinks the shoebox is furniture.  You could buy this with the intention of replacing it in a year, the price was $139 when I purchased mine so maybe it was worth it.  However, I’m going to try to find a better one.  Does not clean (Carpets) as well as my Dyson, as nothing really does, but it does a good job for the minimal effort.  On carpets, it sometimes poops out pet hair which seems counterintuitive.","Reviewed in the United States on May 28, 2020"

I've been impressed with where it goes and the ""four-wheel drive"" action that it has. It's so great that it just automatically goes back on to it's charger when it feels the need to recharge. Run time is impressive. Just be sure to remember to empty the bin every so often depending on how dirty your floors are.

For a while we loved our E-vac (we named her DeeDee, the Dbot and spoke fondly to her by name)... but then she started making a horrible noise. All troubleshooting was a failure so the company sent us a new one. (Excellent customer service I will say!) Sadly a few months later a different and even louder noise started happening. Not wanting to ask for a second replacement...Husband decided to order a Roomba when he saw one on sale. We have only had it a week, so longevity is still to be determined - but cleaning power, ability to NOT get stuck on certain things, and ease of setting it up on a schedule = all so much easier and better with the Roomba.We have 2 dogs that shed like crazy and another dog who chews up toys like crazy and little bits are often found on the ground - Roomie (her name now) is doing a great job getting it all up!  She’s a little louder than DeeDee was before her issues... but I attribute that to being stronger and sucking better. <U+0001F642>So, if you are in the market - I say just go for the more expensive one.

"300","Horrible vacuum cleaner!!! I've had this for 8 days and I will be returning ASAP. The suction power is soooo low. The whole purpose of purchasing this was to eliminate 1 chore from the list of things to do. Absolute FAIL. You have to direct it to pick up items off of the floor , it has no sense of direction, it gets stuck, it goes around the whole house looking for the home station. This is only good for light cleaning. It's no help with getting dog hair or cleaning carpet.","Reviewed in the United States on May 24, 2020"

Half the time, it stops mid-vacuum and just beeps incessantly (think it's the bin? cool, empty it. still beeps) It can't find its way back to the doc to save its life. The list goes on.For a vacuum that costs close to $200, this is just completely unacceptable.My advice? Go elsewhere.

"360","I picked the Deebot because of the suction power for picking up dog hair and it'd been pretty good for about a year. Right after the warranty expired, I started noticing issues with its performance - running into things more frequently, getting stuck, brushes sometimes not spinning. Finally after 1 year and 4 months, the side motors completely gave up on me and will no longer spin. Since the side brush motors will not spin, the Deebot will not move more than 1 ft from the charging base until it stops and beeps twice until you turn it off. ECOVACS recommended a robot vacuum repair center which costs $60 roundtrip shipping and unknown repair costs since my warranty expired - making it more expensive to fix the thing than buying a new one. Of course for a 1 year 4 month shelf life for this type of product, it's not a purchase I would make again nor would I recommend. iRobot I hear is more repairable so I'll give that a shot next!","Reviewed in the United States on May 4, 2020"

After calling support I was advised to clean the bottom sensors and “hit the vacuum 7 times on the front and 5 times on each side.”  This failed to fix the issue- the vacuum still only spins in circles while attempting to go in reverse. I called ECOVACS support again, and was advised that, as my original unit was now 1 MO out of warranty, I would have to pay for a repair to the replacement unit as they do not warranty replacement units. To summarize, 2 units have failed for different reasons, and ECOVACS will not warranty any replacements offered-makes you wonder why you would invest in a product they refuse to stand behind.","Reviewed in the United States on May 3, 2020"

"367","I love this Deebot! I have the N75SE which is the exact same thing as the N79S, only difference is the N79S is sold on Amazon and the N79SE is sold at Best Buy. Even though I did not buy my robot on amazon I always count on the reviews when buying a product.For the price point this thing has surpassed all my expectations. I have two cats as well as my roommate. I run my N79SE every night and the bin is always full. Now I see some reviews saying it cannot navigate around their home properly or cannot ever find it's way to the kitchen or the bathroom. Well do the research before buying, it navigates completely at random despite the bumpers and IR sensors. It has no cameras nor a laser so it cannot navigate like the higher end models. Also someone commented that the model in their manual said N79S and the robot says DN622.11, it's the same thing DN622.11 is the model that's used world wide.Pros: has great suction for the price. Runs for a good amount of time before needing recharged. I get about 1 hour on carpet. Run time depends on the surface its ran on. Longer on smoother floors. It automatically returns to its charging base before the battery dies completely. Super easy to clean. Love that it has four ways to turn it on, app, alexa/google, remote, button on robot. Great that you can navigate using a remote or app like it's an rc car which comes in handy. Also super quiet.Cons:Does take a long time to charge in my opinion. About 4 hours. I have a ledge that goes from carpet to laminate and when the sun is reflecting off of it near the ledge it seems to go over it probably 3 out of every 10 times I run it in those lighting conditions which is evening since the windows face west. Morning midday and night I dont have the issue. Since it does navigate randomly it doesnt always get where I want it to unless I use the remote to put it there and spot clean or put up a barrier. Lastly this is the first robot I've owned so I'm not sure if comparable ones are the same but it has issues getting onto the base. Some other brands are more flat so it can just slide on. This one has a nodule for the front wheel so it cant always get on it right away. Sometimes it does it the first try, sometimes it takes 2-3 minutes, and sometimes it knocks the base over or gets stuck on it but that hardly happens and usually only acts like a drunk sailor for a minute or two then I hear the beeps that it made it. Also if you set a time schedule to start automatically I reccomend the app to be used for it. The remote will do it but only goes in 15 minute increments unlike the app and if you do set the schedule time on the remote even though once you're done and hear the robots beep confirmation always make sure the remote is in range of the robot when the time comes otherwise it will not start. But overall for the price I'm very happy. It makes a great starter robot. I would not buy this one expecting it to work just like the high end types of another brand as other some reviewers have indicated how disappointed they were when it didnt do what they thought it can do but in fact did exactly how it was made to do.","Reviewed in the United States on May 1, 2020"

It successfully picks up everything on the floor. While it doesn't have some of the programming functions of a more expensive unit it does the job that we wished it to do with no problems. All of our floors are hardwood or ceramic tile but we do have some throw rugs in places and this little guy climbs right over them and off the other side and does a fine job cleaning them. We're very happy with this unit.","Reviewed in the United States on May 1, 2020"
"370","We had been delighted with Donald our Deebot and have recommended to our relatives. Over time we started to notice that Donald would not always avoid colliding with objects as it moved around the house. We began to see a pattern. When doing edge cleaning that it would use the bump into the wall when running in a clockwise direction, but it would avoid the wall in the anticlockwise direction. As time has passed, the collisions have increased, and after doing some research, the issue is that the front lens gets dirty and scratched, preventing the sensors from detecting the wall. I decided to service the front bumper, and to my surprise, I discovered that the left side sensor array is completely missing from Donald. In other words, Donald has been partially blind from birth.","Reviewed in the United States on April 30, 2020"

"372","I took my time analyzing Deebot before writing a review. Sorry for the delay. —- After reading some review, I was a little skeptical, since I am an international buyer. But since I got coverage for 3 years, I decided to buy it. Because who gives a protection plan for 3 years if the product wasn’t going to make it. I do not regret it. Some people complaint that it makes some noise. Well, it never said it was noiseless. According to me, that noise is normal, acceptable and necessary for you to know Deebot is coming. Does it get stuck? Yes, sometimes. It depends on what you have in your house. I have a carpet, handmade with long strings, logically it will pick all the strings until getting stuck. I have a standing lamp, which it will climb on the base, but after that will loose control of the wheels and will stay hanging like a turtle on the lamp. Do I still have to help Deebot. Yes. Of course, Is a robot. Thank God. Now that I know the dangers in my house, I took care of those to protect my Deebot. I am happy, cleans hard floors perfectly, house is always clean. I use the app to see if everything is under control with Deebot ..... and I get to relax, watch television, drink coffee and have my house clean up.","Reviewed in the United States on April 30, 2020"

In March it started giving me an error, side brush malfunction. At the time I replaced all the brushes and if I pushed the button a couple of times it would work. As April came it wouldn’t even work. I contacted customer service and they walked me through all I already had done, but did it again just in case. Well after all that they said it wasn’t under warranty.

"379","Within a couple months my Deebot started emitting a 4-beep error message. Some research suggested the brushes needed cleaning so while I periodically cleaned them anyway I just replaced every brush and filter on it since they're fairly cheap. This temporarily resolved the issue.Within weeks the error messages returned and a subsequent replacement of brushes did not resolve the issue. The Deebot would run for maybe 2 minutes, stop, and emit an error message. I'd push the button and it would again run for a couple minutes and stop again. I became a slave to this thing.Shortly there after the robot stopped working all together. On the dock the light would pulse blue then go out. Even though this thing had been run for only a few months I replaced the battery since I know these Lithium batteries can go bad and they have a cycle life anyway. That didn't fix the problem. Deebot is still dead. By the way, it is a plug in battery not the kind with clips so don't direct me to that video where they bend the clips to improve battery contact.When this thing was working it wasn't really working all that great and I have hard floors. Then it died. I'm out the cost of the unit and the cost of a replacement battery. Horrible product. Also, completely random cleaning algorithm.

"381","I’ll start off by saying we had been loving our handy little cleaning friend for about a year. We ran it each evening as a nice clean up from the day. Even with 2 dogs and a cat (all short haired), it did a great job of leaving the hard floors clean looking for the next morning. We were regularly impressed with how much dust/hair we emptied out and frequently cleaned all filters, brushes, etc. to keep it in tip-top shape. Then one evening it beeped at us and stopped running. Using the app, we found an error for a “side brush malfunction”. After attempting to fix it for half an hour, my husband gave up and we went to bed. The next night, we tried to run the vacuum again and yay, it worked! For about an hour. Before stopping, beeping and giving us the same side brush error. Well, our luck only lasted one night as it coming on again was apparently a one-time fluke. It will no longer run so long as there is a “side brush malfunction”. My husband did research on it and found this is a regular problem with the vacuum and the solution is a new motor, which costs about $40. So knowing it had a one year warranty, I got on to check my purchase date for a replacement and of course- it was about 2 weeks past our one year warranty. Save the hassle and spend a little bit more to get a good name brand- all of my friends and family who have the more name brand robot vacuums have had theirs for 2-3+ years with no problems at all. If we’d done the same we’d probably still have a working vacuum!","Reviewed in the United States on April 28, 2020"

"386","In my view this has been a very good robot vacuum for the price.  Even though it's a ""dumb"" vacuum with just a bump sensor and no camera or position tracking, it does a remarkably good job of covering an entire area.  It seems to work well for about 700 sq ft at a time, so I need to run it twice in zones in order to get the whole house.  Its suction is by no means a deep clean or a complete substitute for a normal vacuum, but rather than vacuuming manually every couple weeks I only need to do it every few months, so this has saved me a lot of time while still keeping the cat hair under control.The biggest downside for me is the battery life has never been the full 120 minutes that was advertised.  It started out at about 90 and dropped throughout the year to below 60.  I eventually had to buy a new battery.  It does tend to get stuck a lot - under couches, on lamp bases, other random places - so you have to prepare the area before vacuuming to remove everything it tends to get stuck on.I would still recommend this vacuum as a quality choice for someone who wants to try out a robovac.","Reviewed in the United States on April 26, 2020"
"387","I had high hopes for this Ecovac, especially after reading so many good reviews. My high hopes were dashed when it took me several days to actually connect it to WiFi so I could use the features in the phone app. I think I needed to call the customer service line three times. They had me do all kinds of reset procedures, including removing the battery for 24 hours. What was most frustrating to me was the reluctance of each customer service representative to remain on the line until the troubleshooting was complete. It was always, ""Try this and call us back if it doesn't work."" So, after several days of incorporating ALL of the reset and troubleshooting advice I received from the customer service representatives, I finally got the Ecovac connected to the phone app. The Ecovac worked great and I had no issues with it, except that I wasn't able to schedule daily cleanings. The Ecovac didn't understand what day of the week it was! At some point, having exhausted all the combinations for scheduling cleanings on different days of the week, I determined that the Ecovac thought it was Tuesday when really it was Thursday. Frustrated, I returned it.","Reviewed in the United States on April 25, 2020"

None:.....I called Cust Serv and the young lady instructed me to unplug, wait 3 mins, and plug in again..........for three times.  She promised to send an email on how to do this.  It never came, but junk mail, etc could have been an issue.  No change-battery dead....I call again and this young lady tells me to take the battery out, wait 30 mins, and reinstall.  OK.  I do it.  No change.  She promised to send an email too, never saw it.......Now I send an email (to China I am sure) explaining that I just want to chat with a tech person just to be sure I do need a battery (I am spooked that my battery may be salvageable because the customer service girls seemed almost certain that re-booting the battery would revive it).  I explain that I have already made 2 phone calls and related what the instructions were to me.....Ready?  I get an email back that tells me to do the exact same thing that the 1st 2 phone calls told me to do.  That's it.  NO other info.  Scheeeeesh....I send another email asking for a tech and I get an email back directing me to some repair outfit that works on all brands of robot vacs.........not an Ecovac tech.

Seems very likely, but there was no tech person to validate my guess.OK.  179.00 for a unit that works satisfyingly well is a pretty good price.

The cleaning power is great- I love that I can start it from the app when I’m at work. It doesn’t “get stuck” very often. We have had zero issues with it until this last week, which has prompted me to write a review. The vac started giving an error about the main brush so I contacted their support through email. They gave me a few things to try and when we still couldn’t get things perfect, they immediately sent a prepaid shipping label and had me send it in. Right when they received my vac, they shipped me a replacement! I can’t speak highly enough about the customer service. As much as we use the vac (and with how much hair and dirt it cleans!)

I have provided maintenance to this vacuum cleaner every two weeks as advised by the manual, I've changed the brushes and filters many times in order to ensure this cleaner will last us a good amount of years but it is clearly so poorly built, it is made to fail just a few months after the warranty expires (warranty is one year). I contacted the joke they call customer service, who told me in a very rude way that they were aware of this type of issues, that it was common after 15-18 months and told me to deal with it and either buy a new one or get it repaired at a cost that is close to the price of a new one. This is planned obsolescence at its best! So, you can believe the good reviews as it does the job, it cleans pretty well but it will ultimately fail you after a year and a half!

I have had to use it twice to give the Deebot 20/20 vision again. After a period of time, it begins to bump into things and when this does it's because the windshield has become dirty or foggy and it is not seeing clearly, use the headlight cleaner and it runs like new, not bumping into items. Tip #2 use an old soft 2- 1/2"" trim paint brush keep it in the garage by your trash can and regularly dump and gently brush your contents container along with your filters.

I did everything that was asked. Changed all brushes, cleaned sensors and reset as instructed. Nothing. Runs 1 minute and then stops and beeps. Customer service told me to reset, which I did. Nothing. I was told since it’s over a year, I have to pay to have it repaired by a 3rd party.  So, I pay to ship it, they find problem and give me a price for repair. I then have to pay to have them ship it back. No way!  I’m very disappointed. I loved this vacuum so much that I recommended it to several friends before mine died.  One of my friend’s Deebot stopped working at the year mark also. Same model. Maybe this model is defective. Who has $150 to shell out for a vacuum every year?Disappointed","Reviewed in the United States on April 13, 2020"
"428","I purchased this in December of 2018 and am writing this review in April of 2020. In that time, I've had two replacements (3 total vacuums) and in need of a third replacement (a 4th vacuum). However, since my original purchase is outside the warranty terms of service, I will not be getting a 3rd replacement (according to the CSR and their Manager). 6 months into this purchase the side brush motor failed. It was doing nothing but spinning freely. I received a replacement for that, with a vacuum that would turn itself on every night at midnight. Even after completing the factory reset as suggested by customer service. So, I got a replacement for that vacuum. Now finally 6 months after that replace, vacuum #3 is having the same side brush motor issue as vacuum #1, however, the warranty is not one year from the receipt of the vacuum, but rather your original purchase date. SAVE YOUR MONEY - YOU WILL GET EXACTLY WHAT YOU PAY FOR.  This vacuum is not smart, it does not keep track of where it's been, you cannot designate ""no-go"" zones, and it will break down on you very quickly!","Reviewed in the United States on April 13, 2020"
"429","I wanted to love this vacuum, however, they break down QUICKLY!!  I purchased 2 of these vacuums in 2018 and both stopped working within a year's time.  We have wooden floors throughout the house and it does a decent job of picking dirt up.  I would NOT purchase for a house with carpet, not enough suction for that.  My biggest issue though is the lifespan of the vacuum and the awful customer service.  They replaced my first two vacuums, but now I have a broken replacement vacuum (yes, I follow all maintenance guides they give) less than a year after receiving it.  Their warranty starts from the purchase of the original vacuum and does not start again if you receive a replacement.  So now I am stuck with a broken $200 vacuum and no help from the company.  I would STAY AWAY from this vacuum and continue your search.  There are much better robotic vacuums and companies with better customer service out there!","Reviewed in the United States on April 13, 2020"

Now I just run the Deebot whenever.  The. thing seems very durable and is actually quite communicative once you learn what its little beeps mean.  When it turns on it says ""Deebot Go!"" (not really but that's what I imagine the. beeps mean).  I clean it out, use a scissors to free the brushes - all the parts come apart really easily.  If you need to replace any of the brushes you can order replacement parts but I haven't had to do that.

"439","First, a word of advice:  To get your vacuum connected to the app, if you have dual-band WiFi in your home, TURN OFF the 5 GHz band completely to for a connection.  You can turn it back on once you’ve connected the app and everything should work as it should after that.This replaced a 3-year-old well-used Deebot that has just worn out, and the quality has improved in the intervening time.  This does a remarkable job pulling cat hair out of our carpet, and it is much quieter.  A robot vacuum will never be as powerful as a regular vacuum, but this seems to do a very good job with the animal hair, which is the main reason we use one.  For the price, especially if you can find a “Like new” one in the Amazon Warehouse, it’s a good choice.","Reviewed in the United States on April 10, 2020"

We use it maybe once every couple of weeks, or less, so we probably got 30 cleanings out of it before it died. Company response: please purchase a new battery from us so we can profit again from the defective product that we sold you.

Will need a new one but hesitant to buy from any Chinese company that asks for your email to use their app, like this one. As soon as I had signed up, I was getting a bunch of junk email, luckily I used a seldom used email address (which is how I found out). Why would an app like this require an email address is beyond me, unless of course, they are selling your contact info as leads to other companies.Updated from 2 to 4 stars: Good live support from company, main brush need to be cleaned at least weekly to keep it tangle free.I still stand by my strong suspicion that Ecovacs is selling your email as leads to other marketers.

"447","Hi purchased this because my dog hates...HATES...the vacuum. This is very quiet and it doesn't bother him. I also really like it! It picks up a surprising amount of stuff. Great for dog hair and dirt and what not. I have hardwood floors with some carpets and it runs seamlessly between the carpets and hardwoods. I do not set it on an automatic schedule because I had a friend whose robot ran over dog poop when she was at work. I just press the button whenever I want a vacuum and watch it run around the house.","Reviewed in the United States on April 7, 2020"
"448","Loved this thing - bought three of of them (one for me, one for my parents, one for a friend's wedding present). I am constantly surprised by how much dirt and hair it picks up everytime it runs, and we run it three times a week. Sometimes it does miss stuff, though -- which is why I rated suction power at a 3/5.Now, however, two years down the road - it thinks it's falling off an edge anytime it encoutners something dark (like a square on an area rug). It also has to be PERFECTLY on the charging pad, it has almost no wiggle room anymore. It used to have no problem getting itself to charge, but now something is making that hard for it.My parents has problems with the drive motor - it will run for 5-10 minutes, then it siezes up. The wheels won't spin and the brush wont turn. It just stops as if it was over heated, and the engine is jammed.In summary: worked great until it didn't.UPDATE: Tried to contact Ecovac, but their mailbox is full and my message is undelierable.

"449","TLDR;Great for the first two months. Replaced on month three. Wifi doesn't work after six months.Here's the full review:I purchased this from the Amazon Treasure Truck when it was on special last year. It was a great price and my first 'robot vacuum'. It worked amazing. No problems at all. We had it set to a schedule, so it would start cleaning about ten minutes after we left. Once a week, it would lodge itself under the fridge door, or get stuck on the trim between rooms. Not a huge deal. It beeps a few times when it happens, then it shuts off.Two months: We came home one day, and it was stopped in the kitchen. I did my normal trying to turn it on and send it home. It just beeped, then shut off. I searched online to fix it, but even after a factory reset(or at least the steps I read about) it wouldn't work again. I tried leaving it on the charger overnight. I finally reached out to Ecovacs after a few days of trying things. They sent me a replacement and I sent the old one in. Great customer service.Six months: The replacement was working fine for four months or so. I even swapped out all the brushes and filters. One day in late January I realized it was showing the vacuum as offline in the app. The schedule worked, so it wasn't a huge deal. I tried a few things, then reached out to Ecovacs again. After wiping the vacuum, it no longer has my schedule. It is strictly manual use only now. I've done 10 different sets of instructions, including wiping and setting up my router all over again, trying a different router, and a wide variety of other ""solutions"". Nothing worked. It's been a manual only vacuum for three months now, and I've been emailing Ecovacs a few times a week to see if I can get a replacement. I'll update if it ever comes. Many people online have said the wifi quits working on this model after a short time and that it's due to a faulty wifi module.","Reviewed in the United States on April 5, 2020"

"458","Without a doubt the most pathetic and incapable piece of machinery I have ever owned in my entire life, ever. And I've owned dot-matrix printers from the 1980s! This robot has neither the hardware nor the software to be considered anything but an annoying nuisance. I live in a flat ranch style house with very minimal amounts of furniture and obstructions. On a large hardwood space, this thing cannot run more than three minutes without requiring physical assistance. If the sun shines differently on the floor, it doesn't know what to do. The software seems programmed to only tell the bot to maneuver randomly, so if it rolls over a small object it will either continue to spin it's wheels until it has no battery, or beep incessantly until I stop what I am doing and give it assistance. There is no way I could trust this thing to run on its own while I'm away, and no way that I want to assist it fifteen times just to sweep a single room. This automated bot is not worth it, just clean your floors manually.","Reviewed in the United States on April 2, 2020"

We do have to keep throw rugs low pile and a stiff enough base so it doesn't get caught in the suction or brush. When I originally ordered Deebot, My husband was totally against getting one and told me I was wasting money on this thing.  Now, he's asking me to order another one for the upstairs so it can be automatically cleaned daily, too. Amazing how this little vacuum brought him around to a believer in daily, automatic cleaning.  Good price, Fast delivery, Good seller, Quality product","Reviewed in the United States on April 2, 2020"
"460","I did my research.  I learned that the Deetbot was the best robo vacuum for your money. It is amazing!  We have a long haired weenie dog and two cats. I have a Shark pet vacuum, which is great, but I am not the best housewife. We have vinyl plank flooring and big  area rugs. Large dust bunnies lurk in my corners.In an effort to slay the dust bunnies, I bought this vacuum. When you take him out of the box, you need to fully charge him on his base. It took ours about 5 hours. He has several cleaning options: auto clean, single room clean, spot cleaning, and edging.We decided to first do a deep single room clean for all of our rooms.  We let him clean the living room first. The living room has a pet door, so it is a high traffic area. Deetbot can run up to approximately 2 hours without stopping.  We let him clean the room for the entire time. I did pause him to check the dustbin, because I was curious.  It packs the debris so tightly that it is able to suck up a large load.  I was amazed with how much it picked up!  You may want to pause him (via the remote) and dump it a few times just so it has more space in the bin.When Deetbot is finished, he returns to his home base to recharge.  You will want to dump the dust bin after each use. Deetbot comes with a filter that you can wash by hand. We did our whole house without having to wash the filter. I did wash it at the end just to test it.  It is a fine plastic mesh.  I ran it under hot water, dried it, and put it back in the Deetbot.Since we had so much pet hair, we let it deep clean single rooms twice.  Wow! So much pet hair and dirt. My floors and rugs are really clean!  I can feel the difference when I walk on the floor and the rugs.Deetbot’s sensors learn your room and remembers obstacles so it doesn’t keep running into chair legs, coffee tables, etc.  It forgets when you turn it turn it off or charge it, so if you move furniture it isn’t a problem. It just learns the room again.  He can go under anything that is 3 inches high, so he gets all the grossness under your sofa, chairs, and bed.Deetbot easily climbs on top of rugs and doesn’t get stuck. If you have a rug with raggedy decorative edges, it might try to suck them up.  I would take those rugs up or tuck the edges under the rug.Deetbot cleans using an algorithm.  He does not run in a straight path when cleaning on auto or single room mode. However, he uses the algorithm to clean every spot in the room.When you use the edger cleaning, he does make a straight line around your room.  He is able to move around obstacles to move back to the edges.  He knows which areas he couldn’t get because of the obstacles, and makes a valiant effort to maneuver behind or beside the obstacles to clean the edges.In spot cleaning mode, Deetbot makes a 3 minute growing spiral path in the area you need cleaning (like in a high traffic area or if you spilled catnip).He comes with a remote that allows you to choose the function you want. Once you push the button, he is raring to go!  You can set multiple cleaning times with the remote, so if you want him to clean every night at 2 am, he will do it!  The only down side is that if you turn him off, you have to reprogram him again (not a big deal, it is really simple).Deetbot is very quiet. My pets were initially skeptical of Deetbot, but they quickly learned he was not a threat. Now they ignore him.  If he comes near your pet, Deetbot will see him as an obstacle and go another way. My dad’s cat likes to stalk Deetbot for sport, and is disappointed when Deetbot maneuvers around him.Deetbot comes with an app you can use, but it is complicated and unnecessary. Deetbot’s remote control is sufficient.I used it in my elderly parents house, who have four cats.  My mom says Deetbot vacuums better than her biweekly maid (who happens to LOVE vacuuming).I love this robot. My friend has a Roomba, but I think Deetbot does a much better job.  I would recommend it to anyone!  If you have any questions, I am happy to answer them.","Reviewed in the United States on March 31, 2020"

The product itself is wonderful and does a good job keeping the floors nice and decent but the suction isn’t strong enough for tiny dirt particles, which I’m fine with cause this isn’t an alternative to cleaning, it’s an assistant! It sucks up grass and stuff from being tracked inside, kitty litter that the kitty’s kick past the litter mat, cat hair, dog hair, and normal things a traditional vacuum can get up. Long hair gets stuck and tangled badly in the bristles. Kudos for putting in a tool to cut the hair but it doesn’t work that well at grabbing the hair off the roller. I find myself using a stitch corrector(for sewing) and it’s perfect. My Dee-Dee runs every day at 11am while I’m at work and the kids at school and the pets in their cages. I come home to a nicely vacuumed home and I love it! Once a week I do a deep clean and sweep what she couldn’t get and mop.

After 3 months they decided to send me a battery replacement ( by making sure that they make it look like as if they were doing a favor).

"487","We ordered one of these, we have a Bernese Mountain dog and several cats, so things get hairy. All was well until the robot, one day, decided to stop working. I thought that maybe the battery was dead, so I replaced the battery. Nothing. So I contacted support, who after a couple of weeks back and forth sent me a replacement. It did a decent job, and we ordered another one for downstairs. After four months one of the brushes stopped working, and their customer support stopped responding.If they work they do a decent job, you'll need to empty them daily (at least if you have as many pets as we do), and the half inch step between the hardwood floors and the tiles in the kitchen confuses the robot. The base of an IKEA lamp, come to think of it, confuses them. The robot ""climbs"" up the base and just sits there, spinning.I will look for a more reliable robot, but it won't be this brand, the customer support is just not good enough and having two break down in five months does not add to my feeling that these are reliable units.","Reviewed in the United States on March 17, 2020"

"489","I bought Deebot back in 2018 as my very first robot vacuum. Since purchasing, I have used it every day (sometimes more than once if my cats turn it on) and he is still going strong! I have (a lot of) pets... 2 dogs and 4 cats... and running this vacuum daily keeps my house clean! I still run my hand vacuum every few weeks on my carpets since I do have 6 pets, but for the price this vacuum certainly gets the job done!There was a short period of time where Deebot would run for 1 minute and then stop and begin beeping. This went on for days and I was lost without my Deebot. I googled videos on how to fix and it turned out to be very simple! I had been emptying the tray daily and cleaning the filter weekly, but I hadn’t unscrewed the bottom to take the brush out to really clean it (aside from pulling some hairs out while it was still in tact). This did the trick and he’s back to his normal cleaning.I enjoy the multiple functions of this vacuum, though I typically just set him on auto. There’s also a spot clean function and perimeter clean.The only downfall to this vacuum is that it’s not a wet vac, but you know that going into the purchase and mopping the floor is not a big deal when you’re home is vacuumed daily by Deebot. Also, he occasionally gets stuck on items left on the floor, but that shouldn’t deter you from buying this vacuum since every other robot vacuum I assure you will do the same thing.I highly recommend this robot vacuum and have even bought one as a gift for my brother who also loves it too. In my opinion, if you want a good robot vacuum that will last for a long time, then this is the vacuum you’ve been looking for.","Reviewed in the United States on March 15, 2020"

I have purchased all new replacement parts, filters, main brush, side brushes. I was continually getting a main brush error and noticed that even with the new brush it wasn't spinning well.

"520","Carpet, not so well.  On carpet it grinds the side brushes to a pulp, and it doesn't ""Deep Clean"".  On hardwood, laminate and tile, it works like a champ.  It actually surprises me how much dust and crap it actually picks up after I clean it out from its midnight runs.The only bane to this thing is my wife's long hair.  This thing will pick it up and wrap it around the brushes like its trying to asphyxiate itself.  So, I have to save it from itself on a very regular basis (every other cleaning it runs) and take the main brush off to free it from my wife's hair.  Weekly, if I run it more than 3-5 times, I have to take the side brushes off because her hair will be wrapped underneath the brushes and around the drive shafts on the brushes.  Be warned.That being said, when mine dies (and I have had it for two years) I would seriously consider another (meaning, in all likelihood it will be) Deebot for the replacement.  Their customer service is great.  I accidentally destroyed a seal (they don't hold up well to being sucked into a Kirby.... ), and Ecovacs sent me a replacement part immediately...

Most of the time this thing gets stuck on my patterned carpet thinking its falling, gets stuck on desk/table legs and just rams them until the battery dies (I have nice marks on my desk legs from this now), or randomly thinks it's stuck on other small things that it could easily free itself from if the AI programming wasn't so abyssmal. It also likes to spin in circles for 5-10 minute at a time for no apparent reason. Another charmer about this vacuum is its ability to run back and forth in the track of my sliding glass door to the point of where I have black tire marks on my carpet effectively making my carpet dirtier than it was before I ran the vacuum. I have contacted Deebot support twice regarding these problems and they have offered zero resolution. At this point this vacuum is likely going on eBay and I will be purchasing another brand.

"558","I will admit, this thing does great at picking up the dust and dog hair. But as far as picking up anything visible you want picked up, it's terrible at it. Anything that gets caught in the spinning things in the front, it's supposed to send it to the back park to pick it up, but all I see it it just flings it across the floor.PLUS this thing stalls on me ALL THE TIME. I send it off in my tiled kitchen floor, and next thing I know its beeping at me that its stuck somewhere. Except its NOT stuck...its the middle of my freaking kitchen in a wide open space!!!So annoying...I thought I did my research but I'm quite disappointed with this","Reviewed in the United States on February 25, 2020"
"559","I bought  this for my mom for Christmas and she loved it. She's in bad health and unable to vacuum so this was a big help to her. Unfortunately, by the end of January, it will not stay in the docking port. I have Googled and tried to look up trouble shooting to find out what the problem might  be but this company does not address the issue. My mom called the toll free number in the booklet that came with the product and they told her to buy a new docking port. They seemed to be aware that it is an issue, but would not even consider replacing it. VERY poor customer service. I would NOT recommend this product.","Reviewed in the United States on February 25, 2020"

"563","When my unit worked, it was great!  Would easily transition from carpet to hard floor to throw rug.  No issues there.  Occasionally, it would bounce on the carpet, but nevertheless, it would get the job done.  I especially liked the Alexa compatibility ""Alexa...ask Deebot to start cleaning.""  and away it went!  Can't ask for easier than that.  Now, my only gripe is...like many others, it stopped working soon after the one year warranty was up.  I would get random errors and it would start beeping.  It seems to be a common issue...probably a filling motherboard.  Be that as it may, I bought another and will scavenge parts from the old unit (filters, wheels, battery,  charging dock, etc.) This time, I took out a 3-year warranty from Amazon.

The suction is not nearly as good as my other robot vacuum I had. Also, the spinning brushes are quite soft which not only makes it harder to clean it and get the hair out of the brushes, but it also doesn’t clean the carpet as well either.The video is every time it lands.

"573","I love the deebot when it's working. The amount of dog hair it picks up is incredible. It's not perfect and doesn't remove the need to vacuum/sweep, but it does pick up a lot in between larger cleaning sessions.My issues with it:-it gets stuck sometimes (like under the fridge) and doesn't ever learn not to go back to those spots.-it doesn't last long. The first unit I had failed in under a year (so was covered by the warranty). The unit refused to work even after being inspected/cleaned and looked perfect. Deebot replaced the unit with a completely new one, which we've been using for less than a year and it has also stopped working. No reason, nothing stuck/jammed, it will just power on and clean for a few minutes before stopping.

Sent them videos and pictures of the unit you could tell it wasn't abused it still had 46% of working life till it needed to be serviced.  It just quit vacuuming and just over a year it is out of warranty.  Tough you are out of luck here is a company you can send it to so they can fix for a $19.99 shipping fee and when it gets there they will tell you how much it is to repair it and if you dont want to pay that then you can spend another $19.99 to have your dead unit sent back.  Or I am sure they will keep it fix it and put it back on Amazon and refurbished.  What a racket!!!

"583","I originally purchased this vacuum in July 2018.  It vacuums well on solid floors, and does poorly on low carpet.  It gets stuck completely on high carpet.  After 6 months of normal use,  I started receiving several errors, like ""anti-drop sensor malfunction"" and ""side brush malfunction.""  Replacing side brushes did nothing to clear that error.  Sometimes I could do a quick wipe down of the exterior of the vacuum and that would clear the errors.  Other times, I had to fully dismantle every screw and pull apart the motherboard to get into the wheel wells to get this thing clean.  I'm an electronics technician, I'm pretty sure that type of cleaning is behind the expertise of the normal user.Eventually, cleaning the vacuum stopped working and the errors wouldn't clear.  I contacted Ecovacs who sent us a ""new"" replacement vacuum.  The second vacuum started giving errors almost immediately.  After about 3 months it stopped working completely.  This time, a diode inside the vacuum started leaking and caused discoloration on the lens of one of the anti-drop sensors.  The sensor can't see, therefore the vacuum won't run.  I contacted customer support, who informed me that since I'm outside of the one-year warranty period of the original vacuum, they'll do nothing to help.Let me be clear: they gave me a ""new"" vacuum that lasted just long enough to put me past the warranty period of the first vacuum.  I'm greatly disappointed in the quality of these vacuums, considering TWO of them broke down in less than a 14 month period.  Don't waste your money on this brand.","Reviewed in the United States on February 20, 2020"

It took me a while to figure out that the battery was dead, but by that time the warranty had expired. I even have records of writing the support at Ecovacs about the problem before the warranty expired, but they just said I could buy a new battery (they were nice about it though).So all in all, I would not buy this vacuum today.

"639","After debating for a year, we finally purchased the Deebot N79S last year.  It quickly became one of our favorite devices. Since owning the machine, we purchased replacement parts and monitored the performance on the app and emptied the canister at least once or twice per rotation and did a thorough cleaning of the brushes and parts regularly.  We put in the effort to ensure its longevity, which is why we were disappointed when it stopped working recently, after just a few weeks over our year of ownership.  Amid rotation, it stopped and started beeping for no reason.  My husband googled troubleshooting videos and took it apart and cleaned everything thoroughly and it is still not working. It was a vital part of our everyday upkeep.I reached out to Ecovacs customer service and after having me try a few troubleshooting ideas, told me that I am out of warranty (by just a few weeks) and other than providing a number for a repair center. The warranty online says ""at least one year"". I have referred a friend to this product and even purchased an additional Deebot to gift to my parents this year for Christmas because I was so thrilled with this product. I am now regretting that purchase.  I am so disappointed in the customer service.  I would hope they would stand by their product to perform beyond ONE YEAR.  We are beyond disappointed.","Reviewed in the United States on February 8, 2020"
"640","The vacuum is very good in terms of picking up large amounts of dog hair from 2 dogs who shed a lot all year. I live in a single story 2800 square foot house with all hardwood flooring (laminate in bathrooms and kitchen). This bot does a good job of picking up the dog hair. My problem is with the controls. Unit does not return to base when you select that option, does not stay in one room when you select that option. It seems to like to go to the same places over and over again, often the places where it always gets stuck which is super annoying. I can only use it if I’m home to get it out of trouble and redirect it to where it is needed instead of where it likes to go. Very random pattern. Also I have connected it to my iPhone and it shows as linked but controls often don’t work when I try to use the phone instead of the remote. I reached out to customer service and was told to take out batteries from remote and the unit and wait an hour and reset the unit. This did not help. Next were instructions that included taking the unit apart which would likely void the warranty after I failed so I did not do this and I am living with it as is. I was sent an email to review the customer service I got but when I went to give feedback it had “expired” and would not let me. I guess they don’t really care about how helpful their customer services is. It had not been that long since I got the email. This bot is better than nothing but I would not buy again and would not recommend to anyone that I liked. In spite of the good suction I’m only giving 2 stars for poor controls and poor customer service.","Reviewed in the United States on February 8, 2020"

Not good for deep cleaning, because it doesn't get into corners, but for frequent cleaning it is a great help.

Now they want me to call my internet provider and ask them to shut down part of my internet... not all of it, just part of it. This is absolutely ridiculous. I had to send back the first one for the same reason, being told the new one would be good. It is not. It is exactly the same as the other one.

I have been hung up on, put on an indefinite hold and STILL it is not connected. I set a cleaning schedule on the remote, and we will see if it actually works. Last time, I also set a cleaning schedule on the remote and it didn’t work. When I first got it, it was totally fine. Worked great.

"693","This is my first robotic sweeper. I've had it for three months now, and run it at least once a day. We live in a three adult, two kid, one dog house and I work full time, plus a part time job, as well as homeschool my daughter. BUSY. No time for sweeping and vacuuming. I was getting tired of all of the piles of dog hair along the baseboards of our 1600 sq. ft. tile and area rug home so I purchased this as a birthday present to myself. I am SO glad I did.Pros: Deebot is great at picking up dog hair and dust from the the hard floors. He's also great at picking up larger scraps and particles from the area rugs. I empty the bin after every run, and it is always half to completely full, every day.The battery lasts long enough to sweep about half of the house. I have it set to clean the common areas during our sleeping hours, and during the day I let it loose in the bedrooms. Those areas are separated by a mounted baby gate, so it works perfectly with our set up.It forces me to keep my house picked up. That doesn't come naturally. But knowing that it is going to come on every night is motivating. I don't want to be woken up to beeping because it ate something it shouldn't have.Cons: The timer is not too consistent. If I change the time I want it to come on, it doesn't register right away. I usually have to turn the vacuum off at the switch, take the batteries out of the remote, reinsert batteries and reset the time and timer. It is a pain. I haven't figured out the problem yet.I can't get it to work with our wifi. I haven't tried too hard because the remote does all of the same things as the app, but it might be a problem for some.One other thing. One night a left a covered tumbler of water on the floor by the couch. When Deebot came on, he knocked over the tumbler and sucked up all of the water over the course of his shift. I woke up to Deebot sitting in a puddle. I resigned myself to the fact that I screwed up and would have to replace him, but decided to try to dry him out. I took out the brushes and dust bin and left him in the laundry room for 36 hours. When he seemed to have no more water seeping from his seams, I reassembled and started him up. Much to my surprise, he performed as if the water incident has never happened. I don't expect that would be the case every time and I am very careful to keep my tumbler off of the floor now.","Reviewed in the United States on January 31, 2020"

I definitely heard from them, but each time I would respond to their question, a new customer service rep would get involved in the conversation and basically all of them said the same things and made the exact same suggestion.  Those suggestions did not solve the red light and 3 beeping sounds.The next step is sending the vacuum in for repair.

I imagine the more expensive robots are better in some ways - but why spend the extra money for something that already does a great job! Sometimes Robbie has a hard time getting home - but my house layout is not large and a straight shot , but smaller rooms.

But within 6 months I had to contact the company because it stopped working (Amazon couldn't help) and it would just spin around and around and finally shut off and beep.  I have had a Roomba so I knew that the sensor was more than likely stuck, or the brushes had a problem.  So I had done the problem resolving prior to contacting them.  Once they responded, which was fairly quick, we had some back and forth trouble shooting and they sent me a label to return the machine and send me an exchange.  They come with a 1 year warranty from purchase date.  That was #1......to be followed with the second exchange for the SAME thing within 4 months.  But wait, there is more......my warranty was apparently past and I had the exact same thing happen AGAIN....so here went Exchange #3 for the SAME THING......now at this point we are apparently way past the ""warranty timeframe"" but no one EVER mentioned that to me.  I would have thought each machine would be a one year.  So fast forward to early December 2019 and the newest machine starts doing the SAME THING again....I contacted the company on the SAME email thread we have been using all this time and they sent me troubleshooting again.  I responded, politely, and told them that I had done that and this was not my first rodeo, this would be my FIFTH exchange on this robot.  They asked me for a video of what it was doing, naturally I had it all packed up and ready to ship out, but I did it.  They came back with more troubleshooting and I replied again that I had done all that.  So the last email I got from them was explaining that they only offer a ONE year warranty on the item and that was from the Original date of purchase.  Funny no one mentioned that with the last 3 exchanges that were definitely after the one year mark.  I consider myself lucky to have those extras, trust me, but in the end this machine was not made well.  No one should have that many exchanges on one machine in that short of a time.So, if you want something dependable, do NOT buy this one.  I have purchased a few others since then, and if they seem like they will be junk, they go back!  Amazon is the best about that.","Reviewed in the United States on January 29, 2020"

"714","I knew I’d like a robot vacuum but I didn’t know how much I would love my robot vacuum. I named mine Catbot. So Catbot is wonderful with dog hair. I have a lab and you don’t even realize how much they shed until you sweep everyday. I downloaded the app. It was super easy to set up. You can program a schedule which is great. I live in a ranch with wood floors, Berber carpet and a very plushy large rug. I run Catbot in the morning when everyone is getting ready because she bumps into things including bedroom doors so that’s not ideal for sleeping. If we were in a two story I wouldn’t have a problem running her at night. Also I didn’t think she would be able to get on my rug because it’s so thick but she always manages to. She does get the top layer of dirt off it but I’ll still have to go over it with the big vacuum every now and again. Problem is she gets stuck on it a lot. But I don’t really mind. When she gets stuck she stops and beeps. She hasn’t gotten stuck anywhere except on the rug. Does awesome on the wood and Berber carpet. This thing is a game changer!","Reviewed in the United States on January 28, 2020"

"716","I bought this in May 2019 and was initially fairly happy with it. I have a one bedroom,one floor apartment so didn't think the ask was that significant. I quickly learned that it cannot transition from regular carpet to rugs (not even super plush). It also tended to trap itself on various objects, which kind of defeated the purpose of running it when I was not home. It came to the point where I had to be at home and monitoring/babysitting it in order it for it to be even moderately effectively. I accepted that fact and supplemented with regular vacuuming periodically. However, by December, it was completely nonfunctional and no longer works. So I ended up spending $200ish on a mediocre robo vacuum that needed to be babysat, only to die 6 months later. I'd recommend waiting and investing in a higher quality robo vac.","Reviewed in the United States on January 28, 2020"

"721","I LOVED my Deebot N79S for the first year. My device stopped working about a week before my warranty ended which I thought was super convenient. I contacted customer service, we tried to troubleshoot the issue, ultimately they sent me a device to replace my malfunctioning unit. 2 months later my replacement device no longer functions. I have reached out to customer service because a brand new device shouldn't stop working after 2 months, but they will not help me at all. I have called and emailed multiple times, was instructed to call back in a few hours to speak to a manager by a customer service representative, I called back and was informed by a new customer service representative that there were no managers in the office that day completely contradicting what I was told before.Great item for the first year, but once that warranty ends they could not care less about their customers.

"727"," At the time of purchase, the price was $229. You'd figure for that price point, the company would cover internal parts that malfunction for at least 5 years. Wrong! The warranty was only for one year.After 12 months or so, the machine started beeping annoyingly every minute (watch my video). I contacted Ecovacs support and after several emails, I was told the battery was no good and had to be replaced at my expensive. The battery runs about $40 and judging by the lifespan of the original one, it's safe to say you may have to buy a new battery every year or so, which is bull crap.I just can't believe an internal part was not covered for more than a year. I mean, It wasn't like I dropped the machine in water or anything. I took really good care of the machine and by all accounts, it did work well. I even gave them an opportunity to make it right and buy me the part, but I guess having a bad review/unhappy customer didn't matter to them.I'd never buy another Ecovacs machine again. Their warranty simple SUCKS!","Reviewed in the United States on January 26, 2020"

"730","I bought this unit specifically for the Wi-Fi functionality, which has never worked, because my unit was defective upon arrival.Before I contacted the company about my unit's inability to connect to Wi-Fi, I did EXTENSIVE troubleshooting on my own. I'm a technology worker/QA tester by day, and on top of that—not a huge fan of returns/exchanges (takes away all the convenience of ordering a product online). Which is all to say that I exhaust all my options before asking for a replacement.In this case, thinking my unit's inability to connect to wi-fi was perhaps tied to my network and/or phone, I took the N79S to multiple locations to test on other networks—couldn't connect there, either.Among the other troubleshooting methods I tried to eliminate variables, following their support docs:- pairing with different phones—in case that was the problem.- I booted, rebooted and reset all involved devices- changed network names and passwords- deleted and reinstalled the companion app,- made sure I was testing on 2.4GHz networks onlyEventually, it was clear that the the internal wi-fi hardware was faulty, because in the ecovacs setup app, if the DEEBOT can't connect to the network, it is supposed to create it's own wi-fi network for a device to connect to. My unit was incapable of doing that (tested w/multiple devices).I contacted Ecovacs within my warranty period and explained all the troubleshooting I had done, and requested a simple exchange. They asked me to do a bit more troubleshooting I had already done, but I repeated it and sent a response.They asked for more troubleshooting I had already done, and information I had already given—such as what model I had, what country I lived in when I had already sent my proof of purchase, etc.All together, my detailed and simple request for an exchange turned into an 8 (!) email back and forth with different reps, where at one point I was asked what date and time(s) this issue had occurred, on top of being asked to repeat steps I had already done.This was my first Ecovacs purchase, and I have never experienced such poor customer service in my life. It was as though they wanted to stall/wear me out and avoid an exchange. They won, because I eventually gave up. When the vacuum doesn't connect, and I have already explained that I've tried and failed multiple times, being asked the date and time of specific failures is unnecessary.With any mass market product, there are bound to be some duds—I understand and respect that. But I always give a company the chance to make things right. Instead of helping me with the problem and turning my experience with the brand into a positive, Ecovacs made things much, much worse by giving me the runaround. By contrast—I have another robot vacuum by a competing brand (which I wont name because I'm not trying to promote them by tearing down Ecovacs) that developed a problem. One brief support request, and they sent me a replacement within 2 days, before receiving the defective unit back.Now I have an N79S that is basically a paperweight, and has given me more headaches and wasted more of my time than any one product should.My advice is to buy another option in hopes that that company stands behind their products and has competent customer service—otherwise you'll curse the day something goes wrong with your Ecovacs.In short: AVOID this company!","Reviewed in the United States on January 25, 2020"

"739","We purchased the DeeBot N795 to replaced our 2.5 year old M80 Pro.  I didn't think there would be much difference in the cleaning ability, but I was wrong.  We were super happy with our M80, but it died and we needed to replace it.We use our DeeBots every single day so we needed one that is reliable and does a great job.  We nailed it with the N795.  It has better suction power than our previous DeeBot and it is quieter.  The N795 utilizes the same app so we can have one app to control our second DeeBot (upstairs Dee and downstairs Dee).  The app is OK and gets the job done, nothing fantastic to report on the app.Our N795 wakes up every morning at 10am and begins his day.  He usually runs for 1.5-2 hours going over tile and carpet.  We empty him every day and it is amazing how much stuff he picks up every day (hair, dust, etc...).The sensors are OK.  There are times when he bumps into things but its more funny than anything else.  His drop sensors work perfectly.  We have stairs so having good drop sensors is critical.  He makes his way to the top of th stairs and turns right around.  He is a good robot!Overall, we love our DeeBots.  I highly recommend the N795 for folks that need a reliable cleaning robot.","Reviewed in the United States on January 24, 2020"
"740","For your money, this is a good product. It will clean your house/rooms with a simple layout. I've found that it consistently gets stuck and I am not confident that it will clean and return to home base once complete. Every time I run it while we are out we come back to it stuck and we have no way of telling if it was stuck after 1hr or 1min of cleaning. It works great as far as the cleaning aspect, however, looking back I wish I would have purchased one with more software features. It doesn't map out room, you can see where it cleaned, and you cannot set barriers like other models. It just crisscrosses the house with no apparent pattern. Again, not a bad product, but I'd recommend one with better features.","Reviewed in the United States on January 24, 2020"

If you only plan on using the vacuum when you are home then this is fine but I have only had mine for 3 weeks and it has LITERALLY gotten stuck at least 17/21 days I have used it.  It gets stuck and then dies so once you find it and free it up you have to wait to clean until you charge it back up.  If I could do it again I would spend more and get a better version.  I live in a 950 sq foot 1 bedroom apartment and i am afraid to run it while I’m not home .  No matter how much you prep it will find a way to get itself stuck somewhere.

It drives around in clean mode but acts like its looking for the charger (no vacuum, slow speed, slow brush). It only has a 12mo warranty. So it's not worth having. Our shark vacuum we have had for 8 years and cost $160. This is a $250 vacuum and last d $17 months plus multiple replacement brushes which get pretty pricey so a 17 month operating cost is about $310 which is about $18.25/mo.

"780","This Deebot is awesome especially for the price. Delivery was quick as was set up. I'm a single guy with pets and hair is an issue.  I have a small 3 bedroom home with hardwood floors and a couple throw rugs. Out of the gate I'm getting 2 1/2 hours of run time. Maybe since I do not have carpet I get better than expected battery life. The first morning I ran it I filled it up a couple times. I expected that. It sweep under my furniture and beds etc. The next morning the floors still looked great but decided to run it again.  I couldn't believe it managed after 2 hours to fill itself up again. Clean up  of the Deebot is a breeze. Dump it, then rinse everything with warm water and let dry. It's also cool that it parks itself back in the charger when battery is low. The first night it did start working in the middle of the night but that was an easy fix after reading instructions.  You just hold the right button down for 3 seconds and turn off timer mode. I did one room at a time in my testing of it to find trouble spots before I turned it loose on the entire house at one time. FYI,  it will eat a phone cord and if it can get to your surround sound speaker wires it has enough power to pull them all down, it also cant digest dryer sheets but it will try haha. Parts for it are plenty available on Amazon.  Great product. I highly recommend it and my hardwood floors  seem to be more shiny now as well.","Reviewed in the United States on January 18, 2020"

As long as there aren't cords from our kids, headphone, xbox or whatever cords on the ground this little vacuum does great!

"787","I purchased the product in December 2018. I used it weekly on my bare floors, following basic maintenance instructions regarding cleaning of brushes, rollers and emptying bin. It stopped holding a charge in June 2019. I contacted Ecovacs and they sent me a new one in July 2019. I began using it weekly, again following maintenance instructions. In late December 2019, I began having the same problem of the unit not holding a charge. I followed the Ecovacs basic troubleshooting of removing the battery, plugging the unit in directly to the adapter instead of using the base--just as I did with the original unit. The company said that because it was a year past the original purchase date, even though they have record of the replacement in July, they will not do more than send me a new battery. While the Deebot does a decent job of vacuuming up pet hair and minor, daily tracking of stuff, it is not worth the money or hassle of the unit not holding a charge after only 6 months of weekly use. I won't buy from this company again.","Reviewed in the United States on January 17, 2020"

The flooring is approximately 60 years old - real pine and they long ago lost their luster (although my husband did buff and treat them with polyurethane 10 years ago) and the vacuum and swiffer never really got them shiny clean.  Ever since Pinkman arrived, we have beautiful shiny floors now. I'll have to post a before and after shot, and will hopefully be able to edit this at another time (because I don't want to deal with the process of searching through my phone for photos that have the floor in shot) and will hopefully remember to do it in the coming days.

The programming gets stuck to a certain room and it will literally bypass my other rooms to make it to this one room and then it will go around in circles and back up in circles until it gets stuck on the edge of a carpet that is no ore than 1/2"" high.  It will NOT clean entire rooms so I have dog hair and parts of leaves my Labs will bring into the house left on the floors.  I don't have a Roomba and never have, but my son did and he got rid of it for very similar reasons.  I honestly do  not think these machines (Deebot or Roomba) are cut out to do the old fashioned job of a vacuum.

For an added bonus it comes with a remote that you can control the whole vacuum with.  It also connects to your WiFi so you can use the app to also control it like the remote.

I have floor rugs and it goes right over them no problem.  They are rubber backed and somewhat stiff,  if not it would probably get stuck.  I have it set to come on every morning while I'm getting ready so if it beeps I can check it.  I have a little routine now where I hear it come on and I check for socks or cords it may try to suck up.  I have two cats and two dogs and this vacuum has eliminated  my need to manage their shedding hair every day.  My house is cleaner all the time and I dont have to bug my kid to vacuum, it's awesome!  Emptying the tray is easy and I just bang the filter in the garbage and brush it off when it's done each day. It even goes under my island and nightstands which have about a 4 inch gap.  It took a couple of days initially to learn layout but now only minimally bumps into walls.  My pets dont care about it after they figured out it wasnt out to get them.  They just move out of it's way.  7 weeks after purchasing I still love it and wish I bought one earlier.

A lot of the time I would just manually put it backThe sensors are not very good.  Despite its “slim” feature claim it would never go under my couch or certain tables even though they had abundant clearance.Entire product stopped working after almost exactly a year...almost like it somehow was smart enough to break right after the warranty/service help.Pros:It cleaned up dog hair and against the walls really well where a regular vacuum wouldn’t, which was really great in the “perimeter” mode.The suction is great and really made keeping dark floors tidy with short amount of daily use.","Reviewed in the United States on January 13, 2020"

"876","I have two pitties. I run this vacuum twice a day. It does a great job for day to day cleaning to keep hair and dirt off my floor. This vacuum is a life saver as I do not have time to vacuum myself.I’ve read reviews where reports it gets lots. My thoughts: it’s a machine not operated by a brain. It’s going to do things that machines do like get stuck under furniture, transition boards, and may get lost. I pick it up to put it back in track. I LOVE THIS MACHINE.Edit/Update: I still love this vacuum. However, this morning while vacuuming the living room, hardwood floors, it stopped working. I placed it on the charger and it is completely dead!! Has this happened to anyone else? What did you do? It is not even a year old.","Reviewed in the United States on January 7, 2020"
"877","Works great! We have 2 cats, 3 german shepherd Huskies and a Staffordshire. It definitely over exceeded our expectations and for the price, you cant beat it. It has only gotten stuck under our fridge so we block that area off now and sure enough, it works great! Collects a lot more than you would ever imagine. We never intended for it to be a deep cleaner, only to help out during the week while we're at work and running around. No complaints.","Reviewed in the United States on January 7, 2020"

"879","After months of agonizing over which robot vacuum to buy and the high price tag, I picked DEEBOT based on user reviews (and the comparably great price). LIFE. CHANGING. After his first spin around the house (we have tile and hardwood), I christened him Stanley. Next to my husband and kids, Stanley is the best thing to ever happen to me. My floors are clean! It’s like having a maid service! He goes under the kitchen table and happily picks up all the food my kids don’t get in their mouth. After each run I empty the canister, wipe out the filter and he’s ready to go again. Oh - AND there’s a remote control. So if there’s a particular place that I need him to be, I just sit on the couch and use the remote to guide him. If you have tile/wood you won’t be disappointed. I love you Stanley. <U+2764><U+FE0F>","Reviewed in the United States on January 6, 2020"

"901","I was very skeptical, however at this point (I've been using it for 4 weeks now) it does a great job on the floors. We have laminate, tile and low pile carpet.  The bot transitions 9 times out of 10 between all floor types without assistance.  It is not intended for plush or high pile rugs/carpets.  Pick up your bathroom rugs if you are running it in the bathrooms.  We do not have a really good space with a plug to have the docking station, therefore we usually need to use the remote to get ""him"" back into the station to recharge.  The unit is very easy to clean . We have 2 dogs in the house and the bot picks up the fine dirt and hair each run.  I do still use the regular vacuum and dry mop for deeper cleaning. Overall I am thrilled to have my floors look good even when I don't have the time to clean them.","Reviewed in the United States on January 4, 2020"

I realize it's an electronic device, which I don't expect to last forever, but it certainly should at least last several years before breaking.","Reviewed in the United States on January 4, 2020"
"904","It's okay. Seemed easy enough to ""set it and forget it."" But I have dogs. I think one of the dogs didn't like the vacuum or I forgot to let him out because he decided to poop in the room the vacuum was vacuuming. It ran over the dog poop and smeared it all over the room. It got wedged up int he wheel and tiremarks of dog poop tracked throughout the room. It took at least a full day to sanitize and clean up after the incident. The manufacturers should be aware of this happening as should any potential buyers. I never run the vacuum without being around to stop such catastrophes from happening. That nightmare out of the way: It is a bit loud, it is a vacuum after all. It is hard to watch tv or listen to music/podcasts in the same room as it works in. It fills up very quickly and you'll probably have to dump it almost every time you use it. It gets stuck very easily on bathroom rugs, behind furniture, and anywhere with higher carpet. It reliably gets stuck on one particular spot in my house almost every time I use it. Anything you leave in the floor will be sucked into it. It's taken a few computer cords along with it for a little ride until I pull them out. Today I ran it and it took an empty bag of dog food into another room and knocked the fireplace log holder on it's side. It bumps into things and makes very loud noises when it does yet somehow, the sensors on it have always kept it from falling down the stairs. I wonder if the programmers could program it a little better so it could slow down and not make such loud bangs. I think this technology is amazing and can make your life easier. I just think we're in the beginning stages of it's development and personally, I wish I would have waited for a more advanced model that won't have all these problems. It still makes life easier because I don't like to spend time vacuuming!","Reviewed in the United States on January 4, 2020"

We had a Eufy before the Deebot N79 and it got stuck a lot more.  It seems the Deebot is a lot less “risky” in maneuvering, but will still eventually get all walls and corners. I prefer it this way because coming home to a stuck unit gets old really quickly.  It also does a better job of finding it’s way back to the charger.  The Eufy unit seemed to die quite often, even if it didn’t get stuck. I’ve had for over a year and everything is holding up nicely, including the battery.  We also have steps and the sensors haven’t failed to stop it from falling.  I have heard of this happening to some people’s units in the reviews, but the cause seems to be that the sensor is covered with dust. So, as long as it’s swiped clean every once in a while, it should be fine. I’ve enjoyed using it so much that I bought one for my parents this year....and recommended it to many friends. When this eventually dies, I’ll definitely be buying another.","Reviewed in the United States on January 2, 2020"

The batteries are about $30 to replace, more if you buy it from Ecovacs.  I'd spend a little extra and get a better rated vac.  13 months ""sucks.""  It also only does an ""OK"" job when working.

I wish it got corners a little better but I can live with that.  Each time I use it, it “learns” the areas and does better at getting along baseboards and right up to furniture.

"950","I've had this vacuum about 6 months and I *mostly* love it!  I can let it run and it picks up so much crud I never even realized was on my floors. Sometimes it's done cleaning before the battery runs out, but other times it seems like it has more to do when the battery runs out.  The drawbacks are: it gets hung up on cords and thick carpet, which kills the battery so I feel like have to be home when I run it. Also, it fills up fairly quickly and sometimes overflows the contents onto the floor. Recently, one of the spinner brushes has started making a loud clicking sound that I can't seem to fix (one of the brushes spins more loosely than the other, but it doesn't seem obviously fixable), which is quite annoying to listen to. This vacuum won't get all the dust balls in hard to reach places, so you'll still need to vacuum baseboards that the robot cannot access. I haven't set it up to map my house yet, but that feature seems like it would make mapping more efficient. Overall, I am quite happy about my investment because this truly saves me a lot of time as I need to vacuum almost daily since I have a dog and a cat!","Reviewed in the United States on December 31, 2019"

As you can see from the attached video the unit makes a noise from the right side brush.  1st replacement was in December, 2nd replacement was in January. This is the 3rd unit with the exact same issue.  When I requested a refund from the company I was told they would look into it and get back to me. After a week, I contacted them and they said they would only replace the unit. I told them I didn't want a replacement as this was the 3rd unit with the exact same issue. After a few emails back and forth I was told to return it through Amazon.  I informed them I couldn't as it had been over 30days and couldn't return.  I was then offered a 15% off coupon as compensation. I told them I didn't want the coupon as I had no faith in their products.  Even though the unit has a 1 year warranty, they did not want to refund my money. Their last offer was a ""free unit"", but if the same issue keeps happening, when the year is up I will be left with a broken unit and no replacement.  I know this was a long read but my hope is that with will help some one who is thinking of buying this product.  I definitely do not recommend this vac.!Previous Review:It is a great little robot. I like that you can start it by telling Alexa to start cleaning. Picks up dog hair easily.  Mind you we have a small short hair Chihuahua. We did have an issue with the 1st robot.

"961","I own this for over a year. I'm still so happy with my purchase. I own a very expensive robot for my carpeted floor and that one is can not be replaced. It the Neato and I have it for about 6 years. Even Roomba cant replace it. But for my main floor I use this. Is it perfect, no. But it makes my life so much easier. It cleans up pet hair and every day dust. Its always full. It does not get everywhere at all and over the year, I see it starting to miss more, it may need a battery replacement. But it is impressive it held out this long. There is no rhyme or reason where it goes, but it looks decent when I walk in. It is ok on the rug, but not exactly a deep cleaner. I wouldn't use it for carpets. Perfect for hardwood. I don't lift chairs so it has a difficult job to do. Even with that, it's long runtime allows it to get around. Still very happy with my purchase.","Reviewed in the United States on December 31, 2019"

"964","I'm giving the Ecovacs Deebot N79S 2 stars because this vacuum was great when it worked but the infrared sensors have now failed on 2 separate vacuums.  When the infrared sensors are working properly the vacuum will recognize walls and will slow down before making contact.  However, when the infrared sensors fail the vacuum no longer recognizes walls or doors and runs into them full speed.  The vacuum moves fast enough and hits the door hard enough that if it hits our bedroom door it will wake us up at night.The infrared sensors stopped working on our original purchase while the vacuum was still within the 1 year warranty and Ecovacs replaced the vacuum.  The infrared sensors on the replacement vacuum just failed the other day, exactly 1 month after the 1 year warranty expired so Ecovacs will no longer replace it.  Different vacuum, same exact problem.If you want to spend a few hundred dollars to have a vacuum that works for 6 months to a year then this is the one for you.  If you would like something that works for a longer period then that I would recommend you go with a different brand.","Reviewed in the United States on December 30, 2019"

Last year, got a real lemon but couldn't get an adequate response from either seller, manufacturer or Amazon.  This year, decided to give DeeBot a try.  Wow.  Cheaper, same basic design, smaller, lighter, better suction, two broom arms, extremely quiet.  Also picks up finer ""dust"" particles.  Debris holder is a bit smaller than famous brand, but adequate.  Very, very happy with DeeBot, and item description promised service from both Amazon and Deebot.  So far, no problems.  Definitely a superior product.","Reviewed in the United States on December 30, 2019"

I contacted Ecovac customer service and essentially they said that the 12 -months warranty has expired and they suggested a third-party company that could fix my Deebot. Mind you it would cost almost half the price of the robot just to ship it to them.  For a vacuum that costs that much it should last more than 2 years without any problem.

I have had it sitting in the corner hoping it will suddenly start working again.  I guess it’s wishful thinking waiting a couple months of sitting in the charging bay and it not doing anything but collecting dust.  In the trash bin today it will go.So, it is great when it works.  It collects all that extra dust and debris.  I just expected It to work longer than 8 months.  If you have money to replenish it every 8 months go ahead and buy it.

Another 2 months and it quits working again. Repeat process and it worked for a few more months. After 3rd time, could not get it back working. Unfortunately I waited past the 1 year mark to reach out to Ecovac customer service. They strung me along for 2 months having me buy repair kits and following their directions. Once we validated that all their efforts did not fix the item, they asked me to wait two weeks as their internal repair center would be opening.  After 3 weeks of No contact, I reached back out and they told me the repair center was not open yet and to take it to a local non ecovac repair center to dump more money into this cheap product.  Their customer service response time is 4-5 days per email and typically has required my follow up. I have been less impressed with their customer service than I was of their actual product.

(Turns out, our oldest daughter is allergic to the dog. With some changes and some allergy adaptions, she’s no longer on allergy medication.)You can change its direction with the app. We never use the app though).You can see a difference after it vacuums.You don’t have to be home to run it.Downstairs, it does the living room, kitchen, hallway and bathroom in one charge. (I have a 1400 sf house)Upstairs, it does the hallway, 2 bathrooms and 3 bedrooms. (I let it recharge and have it vacuum upstairs). I’ve never timed how long it goes but it goes for a long time.I’ve learned where it gets stuck (there is one spot under the shoe rack) so I put a shoe there to block it.Cons:Doesn’t vacuum the same as a big vacuum, but I definitely don’t need to pull it out as often.Requires you to empty the container after each use.

My favorite function is the ability to control the robot’s directional path with the remote. It’s like a remote control car.

After I purchased my first one, I liked it so much I purchased a second one a few months later. Both worked great for a season. After about 16 months of use, the first one died. I contacted Ecovacs to see if they offered any repair service or could do anything, but they could/would not because it was after the 12 month warranty had expired. Thinking maybe it was an anomaly, I purchased a third Ecovacs Deebot to replace the broken one. This time though, I got the extended warranty and suspect I will need it. Well, as of this week, after 20 months of use, my second one died also. Maybe I’m old fashioned, but I expect a household appliance that costs hundreds of dollars to last more than two years.

I read the reviews for this one and they seemed great so I didn’t understand why anyone would spend $150+ more dollars when this one was working so well. I’ve since found out why. I named it Toto and my husband named it dumb***. It gets stuck on EVERYTHING! A vent on the floor.. the lip of the fridge.. under the crib.. under the computer chair.. etc. each time I blocked where it was getting stuck it would find a new place and I have yet to come home and find it back on it’s charger - I have to press the alarm button to find what new place it got stuck. Now I only run it when we’re at home and my husband and I are going multiple times to “rescue Toto” which takes as much effort as just vacuuming the house.

Which motivates you keep the clutter picked up - another plus. I have a long haired cat, and the cat hair is usually everywhere. Now, I hardly see cat hair much at all when it runs. For a couple of days, I did not run the DEEBOT and it was so noticable! I got that scheduler set back up immediately!

"1052","I wouldn’t suggest buying this robot vacuum. Customer service has been helpful, but now I’m scared to receive the replacement because so many reviews say the second or third crapped out faster than the original one they had. It’s probably because they send a refurbished one back to you. I’ve had my vacuum for 7 months and now it spends in circles and I was told it was a sensor bumper issue. The vacuum was never that good to start with. Bumps every wall and will always run over your feet. I sweep everyday because I have four pets, but this was just a nice backup. I’m going to go through with the return just to have an extra vacuum, but I will definitely be buying a roomba as the main replacement. It’s worth the money to buy one that’s a better quality and roomba stands by their products.","Reviewed in the United States on December 23, 2019"

This robot vacuum can keep up pretty well....as long as we keep up with emptying it.  It is super easy to take apart to clean out but with it's random pattern in which it moves, it takes a long time to get everything.  We also have an issue with it getting stuck, but it does alarm out and we just go to find it and move it.

We recently started using this 4 months ago (we use it about 2 times a day) it was working wonderfully for the first 3.5 months. Then it was starting to stop and beep and the side brushes would stop spinning. I have a feeling that the side brushes are going out because of the random cleaning it does and bumping into everything. I think this because the brushes stop spinning for a bit then when it bumps into something like a wall or door it seems like it glitches and starts spinning again. It’s got great suction power when it actually works. So super bummed I had to give it low star rating.

Cheryl (what we named our robot maid) does a very fine job wondering around the while downstairs maintaining the floors.

While The irobot fails to shimmy itself onto it, let alone START on it. because the front wheel burrows itself into the shag and tricks the poorly placed sensors into thinking its on a “cliff”CostSee for yourself i can buy two n79’s for the same price...NOISESpecs rate the irobot two 2DB. Lower than the ecovac. That may be true but, the irobot makes a morbid grinding high pitch nuisance from the drivetrain while the ecovac makes an even somewhat soothing white noise humFiltrationThe n79 has overall three filters including a washable prefilter that keeps the 2nd and 3rd stage filters cleaner, thus not having to buy a stockpile of filters for the yearThe irobot 675 has one... crappy barely cleanable coffee filter like piece of paper.This is why the irobot has better suction and cleaning power spec wise because it is basically unrestricted airflow.A couple of other quick things-volumeThe irobot doesnt stfu its constantly talking and beeps at fire alarm level VolumeThe ecovac beeps at a moderate volume at start and that’s itThe only pros i have on the irobot wheel/motor assembly are replaceable.Assumably longer lifespanruntime and cleaning power are better on the irobot.. but personally who cares its an auto vacuum im going to be running it 24/7 therefor its eventually going to clean everything","Reviewed in the United States on December 22, 2019"

"1074","This little guy is fantastic. Yes, it's a random only. Yes, it's kind of dumb sometimes. But....it works.We run our Deebot in each room every other day (kitchen/living area one day, bedroom another day). With hardwood and a low-pile carpet, it keeps picking things up.- Alexa integration: it's nice to have, but limited. You can tell it to start, stop, ask it where it is (it beeps), and to go home and charge. You cannot change modes.- App integration: Functional remote with status. Can select everything you can on the remote, but also gives status. The app isn't required, but recommended.- WiFi: Haven't had it disconnect.- Navigation: The IR proximity sensors help it avoid obstacles but it's not perfect. It's wide enough for doors, walls, etc, but it generally won't see narrow objects like a chair leg. Otherwise, it's a lite bump.- Performance: It works well. It keeps picking things up and generally keeps itself clean. Note, we do not have pets. The bucket needs to be emptied about every two room cleanups (say, 800 sq. ft.) but it's easy to do.- Failures: There are some cases where it can get stuck. Rugs with fringe or fuzzy bathroom rugs. These were getting the side brushes tangled. Additionally, there are some vertical geometries to be aware of in the kitchen. With those thick padded standing mats, it can sometimes wedge itself underneath the edge of the cabinet and the rug. Either way, it senses that something is wrong, stops, and beeps (app will notify).- Minor annoyance: The Deebot has preset programs, that you can modify on the fly (say MAX vacuum setting versus normal). But, they do not stick and have to be set every time. Additionally, I don't think the remote allows you to set the vacuum pressure; it's only available in the app.Overall, for how cheap it was on a Daily Deal and our first foray into robot vacuums, this thing has been great at keeping our floor clean.","Reviewed in the United States on December 20, 2019"

The other disappointment about it was that instead of being able to map the house, it would just clean at random intervals with no real sense of I cleaned this line and moving over to the next row it would instead just zig zag...it typically would get most of everything before it ran out of battery and had to recharge.Since the item didn't last long and did an okay job for what it did, I do not recommend this product at all.

It cleans all the places that were hard or impossible to get with our conventional vacuum - under the beds, sofas, chairs, and other low furniture.

It transitions to low pile rugs from hard floor and back without problems.It has all the features we need, and is a great value (we paid $150 on sale). I can't think of any features that we'd want other that it doesn't have. We have not tried it with Alexa yet. Kind of fun to watch it, too.A couple of things to watch out for that we not in the product description:1) The instructions warn against using this with tassled rugs. We have multiple carpets & runners with 2"" tassles, and it does fine. But we have one in the basement with 2 1/4"" tassels that does get caught. (These are about o be trimmed)2) The instructions says the dock needs 3' on both sides and 6' in front clear, but ours lives nicely underneath a hutch with about 2' on either side, and the return to home works all the time.Added 12/30/19 - I was never able to get the app to work (needed to get Alexa to work), and now their tech support rep is telling me that ""the app does NOT work with Google Pixel phones.

I have one pet (a medium-sized dog) and this definitely cannot handle even moderate amounts of fur. Giant balls of hair and dust are left in every room, and I frequently (about 2x er use) have to take out the brush and pull the hair out of it because it stops running and beeps incessantly until it's cleaned. I promise I do not have a particularly dirty house (I do a full floor sweep/mop weekly - this is just for in between). And it's not just an issue with the pet hair. After locking it in a room that my dog is not allowed in, I now have balls of dust everywhere. The cartridge was not full or anything, I think the design just gathers up stuff into a little ball until it can't handle it anymore and it just leaves them (anyone else remember Katamari Damacy? Like that). Anyway, I need to stop writing and vaccum with my upright immediately because it's gross in there.TLDR; if you want all your home's dust and hair gathered into little balls and left everywhere, get this machine.

"1126","To be honest the vacuum works fine but didn't last. If you're going to buy this vacuum be prepared to buy another one rather soon. I bought mine in July 2018, it started malfunctioning in February 2019. (In that time period I was running the vacuum once a day.)  The only way I was able to use it after it started malfunctioning was if I babysat it and restarted it everytime it glitched. I finally stopped using it because I was fed up with it. In December 2019 I returned to it to see if a deep clean would fix the problem. I took it apart and cleaned every nook with a toothbrush. When that did not work I contacted ecovacs to find out they could not help me because the vacuum was outside its 1 year warranty.","Reviewed in the United States on December 14, 2019"
"1127","First of all, I bought this hoping to have some help with the enormous amount of hair that my yellow Labrador sheds all over the house. This robot vacuum cleaner has solved that problem. I run it every day, and now I never see the little poofs of dog hair in every corner.  I give this five stars because it actually works better than my regular vacuum cleaner, it reaches hard to reach places and does a great job around corners.Things to know:1.  Don’t expect this to vacuum like a human. It uses a zigzag type pattern, so initially it may look like it’s going to skip over a spot, but if you let it work as intended, it will get back to that place.2.  It does have some limitations. My house is 2300 ft.², so it will do a good job if I let it work on the whole house at one time, but it is optimal, if I let it work on one part and complete a cycle and then later on the day when it is fully charged, I’ll let it do the second half of the house.3.  You need to empty this out every time it is used, but this only takes a minute.4.  I use mine so much, that I have already needed to buy some replacement parts, but those were not very expensive on Amazon.com and this is a little trade off for such a great help to me. I bought a whole set of replacement parts for about $20, so I’m set, most likely, for the year.5. Finally, one of the benefits for me with a family of four kids and two dogs, is that when I do run this I have everyone pick up the floor really quickly; therefore, that alone has made my house cleaner.<U+0001F60A>","Reviewed in the United States on December 14, 2019"

"1139","Wasn't sure what to expect with this floor cleaner as I have two dogs and have constant swirls of dog hair on my floors in between weekly vacuuming.  I don't rely on Deebot for the weekly deep cleaning I get with my Miele, but I am so very happy how this  little robot can keep up daily with my dogs.  Surprising to me how much it actually does pick up - empty it every half hour on a 90 min run.  I do have to watch in my living room and bedroom as the clearance is just enough for Deebot to try to get under, then gets stuck and I have to pull it out.  Not a big deal compared to how efficient this little robot is.  I researched reviews and talked to friends who have both DEEBOT and ROOMBA - the only difference I can tell between this and ROOMBA is the  mapping capability.  I chose Deebot because it is a fraction of the cost of Roomba and the mapping of the Roomba can be more frustrating to set up than I wanted to endure.  Deebot does the job of getting in under my beds and keeps the loose dog hair off my floors throughout my work week.  Absolutely a must have for me.","Reviewed in the United States on December 13, 2019"

"1148","So this may be more a review of the Neato Botvac D5 than my recently purchased Eco Deebot.Neato Botvac is the unit for you if you enjoy replacing your robot vacuum approximately every 6 months.  After an extensive, lengthy and labor intensive attempt to troubleshoot from home then send off to their workshop the company finally  replaced our unit.  The replacement Botvac lasted 5 months and because it was a replacement of the original there was no warranty remaining.  We were required to send it to an independent repair company who informed us the robot needed a new motherboard for $200.  The original purchase price was $450 and I certainly expected it to last more than 6 months!So far the Eco Deebot is a go getter and is making a good first impression.  I hope it lasts longer than 6 months, but at 1/3 the price of the Neato I couldn’t be happier at the moment.","Reviewed in the United States on December 12, 2019"

We have it tied into our Echo Dot, so I can lay in bed on Saturday morning, say ""Alexa:  Tell Deebot to Start Cleaning"", then roll over and go back to sleep... waking up an hour later to clean floors.FOR THOSE REVIEWS THAT SAY IT ""WON'T HOLD IT'S CHARGE MORE THAN A FEW SECONDS""... we though we had the same problem at one point (pushing top button would result in it lighting up for 2-3 seconds and then shutting off).  There are TWO on/off switches on the robot... the obvious top button, and an easy-to-miss physical switch recessed into the side.  I suspect that these reviewers accidentally flipped the side switch off, and are trying to reactivate the DeeBot by only using the top button.  Hubby and I spent 30 minutes troubleshooting and were ready to replace DeeBot the first time it happened... laughed at ourselves when we realized that all we needed to do to ""fix"" it was flip the on switch (which is different than the ""activate"" button).100% happy with this purchase, it saves me at LEAST 2 hours a week... and our socks stay white because our hardwood floors are so clean!  16 months and going strong!","Reviewed in the United States on December 12, 2019"

Turns out that our replacement doesn’t charge on the charging pad either. I also just learned that the one I bought for my parents stopped charging as well.

"1155","Love this! We originally bought and still have the 500 series, both work amazingly. We have hard wood floors and tile in our whole house with area rugs here and there along with 3 German Shepherds and 3 boys. We run both at the same time to decrease cleaning time and increase the ability to run multiple times a day (like I said we have 3dogs and boys). The only thing I wish they did better was get in the corners (nothing a quick broom doesn't fix). We have also since bought one for our parents. Highly recommend to anyone who is low on time and high on the need for quick easy cleaning. Ease of set up and running makes this so user friendly.

"1173","Trust me when I say this. Trust me really well. This product is good...for a year. There is a reason why the “warranty” only covers for a year. Because after that year ends, it will basically become a door stop at this point. After a year of having it and taking care of it and cleaning it all the time and maintaining it, a “main brush error” comes up. This causes the Deebot to no longer move and beep until you just shut it off completely. Mind you, I really only had this thing be used 3 times a week. So, I figured “hey I’ll clean it off.” Nothing, and the brush doesn’t move, causing the error. So, like anyone, you think “I’ll just buy a new brush, then BOOM, it’ll be back to normal.” So, I buy one, install it, and of course, same error occurs. So, I call the customer service of ECOVACS, and I get “yeah we won’t be able to help because it’s past the warranty and there is no service center near where you live.” Mind you, the warranty is only 2 months past. So, they know what they are doing.So, in conclusion, if you want a good cleaning product for a year, then hey, this isn’t a bad option. HOWEVER, if you are like me, someone who figured if I just take care of it and make sure I clean it often and it’ll last for years, then STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT. Hey, last I’ll say is you get what you pay for.","Reviewed in the United States on December 9, 2019"

I asked how long they provide a warranty for replacements and they said ""we will only honor the 1 year warranty on original purchase"". So they don't put any support behind their brand new replacements and they are fine with sending products that keep failing.To answer some quick questions I keep getting asked.

"1186","I’ve had this for a little while now, and here’s what I have to add.This thing does the job. For the money, absolutely worth it. That being said I’ve got a couple issues.1) This robot is MAD DUMB. Its object detection is lackluster and the pattern in which it cleans is totally random. One day it might clean the whole floor, the next it might decide to spend 90% of its time stuck under a chair.2) It will not transition from a hard floor to a rug. It even has trouble getting onto my 1/4 thin bathroom rug, and often gets stuck doing so.3) Getting replacement parts for this brand is a royal pain. I prefer sometimes to go buy things in a brick & mortar store (I know, shocking), and Ecovacs sells their stuff pretty much exclusively online. It would be nice to be able to get parts a little faster/more reliably.That’s pretty much all I have to say for now. I still recommend the product regardless of the commentary above.

The replacement lasted just over 3 months before one of the rotors stopped working and making an extremely loud clicking sound. It was fine while it worked but constantly found it's way under furniture and got stuck. After the second one quit working they said the replacement didn't have a warranty, nice customer service. I won't be purchasing from ecovac again.","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2019"
"1196","Initially I love the idea of this vacuum. While it doesn’t replace a deep cleaning that need (weekly) from the regular vacuum, it’s it was great for daily maintenance. I used it because I had because I have multi levels in my home and am physically unable to carry the heavy vacuum up and down the stairs every day. When the unit was working, it did take quite awhile time to run its course (1500 ft area), and frankly, could drive a person crazy unless you walk away and forget the crazy patterns it cleans in.  The charge usually lasted a good amount of time and did pick up quite an impressive amount of small debris for not being a conventional vacuum. (Better than the small stick units.) However, and this is the major complaint- even with routine maintenance, it lasted an unacceptable amount of time before the Deebot stopped working altogether. First sign of malfunction was it just cleaning in circles. Of course, trying to troubleshoot, checking that it wasn’t in “spot cleaning” mode, taking the bumper from and checking for stray debris, following every direction several times over to no avail,  RENDERING THIS UNIT USELESS. The response from the barely existent customer service was to “hold onto the unit,” and “maybe in the future they will have a repair dept.” !! What a horrible way to conduct business! You would think they would stand behind their product as any reputable company would. What a waste of money for what seemed to be a great concept. I will be purchasing similar unit, just not a Deebot from Eccovacs.","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2019"
"1197","Purchased 2 of these 14 months ago.The robot started to beep without stopping, after contacting the customer support it seems that the battery died.Since the warranty is for 12 months, they sent me to purchase a new battery.So basically I purchased a $230 product, that within a tidy bit over a year became a brick. Extremely poor customer support sent me looking for a better product, hopefully one that will last for more than a year.Regarding the performance of the product - the suction is 2/5, the coverage is 3/5, returning to base is 1/5 (I always need to do it manually), and the longevity is 0/5. Don't be tempted by the price, it's just to pull you in before they throw you under the bus a year later.","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2019"

"1210","I purchased this machine in July 2018 and was initially impressed with it because it saved me the headache of vacuuming and also kept the house cleaner than I could since I could have it vacuum daily whereas I may only vacuum weekly. Additionally, this machine picked up so much dirt daily that I did not even realize was there. Unfortunately, that is the extent of the benefits of this device.The machine works like a chicken with its head cut off and does not follow a pattern which often leads to it missing areas of a room. The app is subpar and often randomly resets the schedule cleaning times. The remote randomly lost its connection to the machine. The machine only supports 2.4ghz and not 5ghz so if you have google wifi where it automatically decides the band, you will struggle to connect the deebot to your devices. The machine allegedly supports google home and amazon alexa; however, I have been unable to make it work with either of those assistants.Regardless of all those flaws, I was happy with the machine because it made my life easier--after all, thats what machines are for. And then I got the dreaded 4 beep error. The machine beeps nonstop in sets of 4. Initially, I thought this was because the main brush had hair in it. I took apart the main brush and cleaned up a TON of hair; however, this did not solve the beeping issue. After more research, I found out that the battery has reached the end of its life. After less than 18 months, the battery on this device crapped out and rendered the device inoperable. I reached out to ecovacs in hopes of getting a replacement battery under warranty; however, their warranty for the entire device is only 1 year.It is abundantly clear that this is a case of planned obsolescence and that deebot devices have a lifespan of less than 2 years. Although this was a good device, I would recommend buyers find a brand that makes a higher quality product and one that stands behind their product more than ecovacs and deebot does.","Reviewed in the United States on December 5, 2019"

"1214","Its great for running on bare floors and keeping the floors generally clean.  Not made for rugs or carpet with long fibers.  One of my gripes is the sensing system.  Since it doesn't keep going until it runs into something like other robot vacs, it stops too short when heading straight for a wall: it often leaves debris in a corner.  Certainly makes life easier, but doesn't completely eliminate need for full vacuum.","Reviewed in the United States on December 4, 2019"

Ran almost 2 hours first time. The bin was full and we were shocked how well he ran.You are not required to use the phone app or connect the Deebot to your wifi, but the app gives more functions. Like checking filter and brush life. The remote allows setting 1 schedule and only one time per day. The app allows more granular control allowing day selection and time of day. This is one of the top rated vacs for under $200. Try this one before you spend more on a different robot vac. We love it.","Reviewed in the United States on December 4, 2019"

"1219","This thing does it’s job, but it does it in a slow and non logical way. I’m not sure how it’s programmed but sometimes it senses the wall & avoids it (staying a foot away, so it doesn’t clean the edge) and other times it bangs straight into it. Other times it will climb over a threshold & other times it spins around and leaves. I often see it try to leave a room, hit a corner of the doorway & do a 180 deg turn & spend another 20 minutes in the room. It does not “map out” your space, it just waits until it hits a wall & turns back around on an angle. It’s the roomba’s dumb cousin.  I made a mess it in my room & it did clean it all up. I had to lock it in because it kept trying to leave. It is obsessed with my couch spending 80% of the time in my living room cleaning under the couch. I have a raised couch with slim legs, it’s not stuck underneath it just loves going back to it over &over. Some positives, it’s quieter then the roomba, it eventually cleans the whole space, my dog only slightly hates it. I’ll write an update review in a few weeks.","Reviewed in the United States on December 4, 2019"

He was not the most expensive model, but it is hard to believe that the higher priced ones could work any better.  He has picked up dog and cat hair in places I didn't know it existed.  There has been no problem with throw rugs, fringe or any other issues I was concerned about.  He had a wonderful time under the bed and picked up an accumulation of dust.  It is embarrassing how much I missed in my cleaning routine.  I have two cats and a litter box in my laundry room.  He picked up all the grains that cats track.  He even picked up whatever was caught in a throw rug and also grains that were trapped in a sponge rubber mat that was beside the litter box.

It doesn't create a pattern or know when a room is finished so if you're going to be particular about that, you'll have to watch it and direct it. I have a large open concept layout and it eventually gets most of the space. If it is cleaning one enclosed room, it does better at figuring out the boundaries.

"1239","I read somewhere that the DN79S is the same thing as the DN622.11.  First,  I hate writing reviews so the fact that I'm writing this says something.  We bought it about 6-7 months ago?  And after the first few days we said if this thing only lasts us half a year, it would have cost us about $1 a day and we asked ourselves if it was worth it.  Completely! and we normally wouldn't say that.  We figured we would run it everyday for the first week and then figured we'd only run it every other day or every third day after that.  Were we wrong!  We run it every day - plus often spot clean around the island counter because our kids are messy eaters.  We have a boxer and didn't even think it shed that much.  We were wrong again.  My Honey empties the Deebot everyday and he says he's ""disgusted"" with what a good job it does.  ""It gives you low self esteem.""  Low self esteem aside, we are very happy with it.We read a funny review of this when we bought it in the spring saying the Deebot is great but it is sometimes dumb.  Sometimes it takes more than 5 minutes for the unit to find the docking station.  Sometimes it's within 10 feet of the docking station and it starts to veer off somewhere else.  It gets caught on cords,strings, backpack straps, shoelaces,  and paper towels - but we are really at fault for that.  We have a small powder room and sometimes it gets stuck behind the toilet.Installing the App was simple enough for our then 9 year old to do it for us.  (Though that doesn't speak to whether we could have done it ourselves or  not.)  You can change the cleaning schedule via the App - we turned it off while we were at the beach.  You can set it to run every day or whatever days you want.  You can have multiple cleaning schedules.  You can turn it on manually and steer it with the remote.  For some reason, i's hugely gratifying to steer it to clean a small area instead of getting out the dust pan and brush.  It has a room cleaning feature though we never bothered to learn how to do it.  (I'll ask my 10 year old to set it up one of these days)  It has an edging feature to go around the room and it remembers eventually where all the permanent walls and furniture is.  It also seems to sense when there is an obstacle in front of it but we're not sure because it has such a RANDOM cleaning pattern.  If there is an actual pattern or algorithm, we haven't figure it out yet.  But it gets the job done. (98% of it anyway)  If you at some point don't just stand there and watch it clean for awhile, then you're a better person than we are.  I am sometimes mesmerized by it.We thought the dog would go crazy around it but he just ignores it.  He's a 75 Lbs dog that has stepped on it accidentally a number of times and SirCleansALot (that's what our daughter named it) doesn't seem worse for the wear.It has a standard and a maximum vacuum setting but we only run it on the standard suction.  (Think how low our self esteem would be on the maximum setting).  It doesn't suck up our dog's food on the standard settings sometimes - but probably because the pieces are too big.Both filters and brushes can all be replaced - the App has an indicator that lets you know about when the items should be replaced but use your good judgement and then you can reset the reminder once you've replaced the items.  It's most economical to buy the packages that has everything.The Deebot really works best for people who have all one flooring like hardwood or vinyl planks or tile, etc.  We also have low weave area rugs at all three of our doors and it has no problems with them.The noise seems loud when it starts but it quickly becomes background noise.  We can't use it at night because I'm a light sleeper.  The run noise itself doesn't bother me but the beeping when it turns on and when it docks is really loud and wakes me up because we live in an open concept house.Totally worth it.  And if it isn't worth it to you, return it - but it's worth giving it a try.  It really keeps our floors so much cleaner.  I haven't really brought out the broom since we bought this.  It's kind of like having a maid come to you house and sweeping/vacuuming your floors every day.  (I only gave a 4 for deep cleaning because we don't have plush rugs so we don't know.)","Reviewed in the United States on December 2, 2019"

And believe it or not, the canister fills up every time.  How is this possible???  I only have one dog. But I love that it goes under the sofas, under my bed, under the armoirs, it goes under everyTHING.  Hard to do every time you sweep even if you do have OCD about dust under the fridge and stove.  No, it does not go under the fridge and stove, but I now have time to do that myself because this thing is cleaning the rest of the house.  It picks up glitter from Christmases past and present for crying out loud. Did I say it is amaZING?!Minor annoyances: it gets stuck sometimes on chords that need to be put up; can't quite get the timer to work just right; if it goes off in the middle of the night you might think someone is in the house because you forget about it and then it's off banging into baseboards; sometimes it can't find it's way home before losing power.Pros: Battery life still seems to be going strong; canister cleaning is a breeze; moves from entry carpets to hardwood floors with no problem; collects the tiniest of particles; gets the carpets under the bed perfectly; dog ignores it now that's it's been around a year (she previously moved to another room); relatively quiet (but it is not exactly a silent machine).","Reviewed in the United States on December 2, 2019"

It was even entertaining to watch it aimlessly bounce around my apartment and run into walls. My love affair ended when it stopped charging out of nowhere. I've tried every type of troubleshooting you can imagine. Now it's such that the blue charging light will blink for a few minutes (giving me a sliver of hope) then cut out after a few minutes as if it decided to stop charging itself.

Yes it gets stuck on occasion, but out of maybe 28 runs in the week(I have two now, and they run twice a day), maybe one does not make it back. It is usually some part of my house that gets it stuck. That is 28 times I did not have to vacuum, and my floor is swept.  10/10 worth it.The bad:The reason I have bought it 4 times is... it will attempt to pick up dog indiscretions. This kills the deebot. I do not blame the robot, it is very simple. I immediately ordered a new one the second the old one went  in the garbage. Every. Single.

I contacted customer support and they did trouble shooting. The issue continued to happen and they would try and trouble shoot. I advised that I felt something was wrong with the unit since it continued to have the same issue. The unit quit working right at the year mark. Of course at that point they told us there was nothing they could do and we would have to buy a new unit. I’ve complained that they should have replaced the unit when it started having problems months ago instead of the constant trouble shooting. It appears many others have had the exact same issue based on the reviews. Spend some more money upfront on a different brand unless you want to throw away your vacuum in a year. It’s very disappointing we spent this much money on something and a year later we are throwing it away. We also used it way less than the recommended amount. We used ours 2-3 times a week. Junk!

However the warranty replacement failed with a main brush issue after 8-9 months. Only ran it twice a week so it wasn't overused or abused.

I wear many hats and can’t be everywhere all the time so this little thing has really made my life easier. I call him DeeBo (like from the movie Friday). When I leave for work, Deebo goes to work. He cleans my floors and my carpet and I come home to something clean! He also has a feature to set him to go off at certain times. He goes off In the middle of the night so I empty the tray before bed and in the Morning. It’s super easy. He will get caught in those fur rugs so I just roll ours up quick and tell my daughter she better pick up her toys if she doesn’t want Deebo to eat em. I’ve found toys and hair ties before and you can easily remove what you want from the tray.

I spoke with tech support again, who had me reset it again and that seemed to fix it for a little bit. But when it happened the third time Ecovacs replaced it.The replacement arrived about a week after I sent back the original one and it worked for about a day or two then the issues started. It was turning on at midnight and getting stuck on the stairs. Ecovacs said it may be the carpet but the pervious one did not have this issue and it was the same carpet and stairs. After some more troubleshooting Ecovacs replaced this one too.So now we're on robot number three. This one instantly got stuck on the stairs and at this point I just kind of had enough with the robot and contacted Amazon who offered to take it back and give me some credit for it.Overall, I don't think it was a bad basic vacuum but after having it replaced twice, I just had enough with it and wanted something else.

It keeps my house looking picked up daily now instead of the maybe bi-weekly vacuuming that was happening before.There are a couple of things I don't love about it, but I accept since I didn't buy one of the more expensive brands. I need to put my kitchen chairs up if I want it to do a good job under the table (which is a minor complaint). The big thing is I have to rescue it quite a bit. If it had a smart feature where it learned my home, this probably wouldn't happen so I concede to my not buying the more expensive options. But it's always getting stuck on vent covers or under my coffee table and sometimes in new places that make no sense. Because of this, I only run it when I'm home. Otherwise it seems to get stuck within the first few minutes so what's the point. This makes the scheduling feature pointless. I work from home so it's not the worst thing for me to just remember to run it.

Some notes I have no pets, don't have long hair, tile floors, and it runs 5 days a week 2 hours before I leave in the morning. It keeps the place mostly clean but I still need to vacuum and mop.I love this little robot. It's allowed me to spend less time cleaning. It picks up a decent amount of dust and dirt especially from furniture that I fail to clean under regularly. It's roughly 2 hour battery life is good, as its not a smart vacuum in the sense that it doesn't map your house, it simply meanders around. It can be quite annoying to watch it clean a corner or under the same chair for 15 minutes. While we're on annoying, if you run this while you're home its like having someone with little hand held vacuums following you around for 2 hours. If you think you can ignore this more power to you. Feel free to run it while you're not home but if you have an alarm with a motion sensor the vacuum will set it off.This is not a set up and forget type of device. It does require some TLC. Depending on your hair you should check the brushes and rollers regularly. It also needs to be emptied on occasion. Aim for every 3-5 uses. Parts will also need to be replaced on occasion.Cords. This little robot loves to eat up cords. Any cord it can get its greedy little brushes on, it will attempt to eat and then proceed to drag them all over the house until it senses a problem and shuts down. This shut down is inconsistent and I've had it rip out phone charges and then drag said phones around the house. This could be a concern if you have any light items that could be dragged off of high shelves or tables and break. At least if it does this it'll clean up its own mess. Make sure you keep all cords off the floor where this device will be operating. Some simple Velcro cord controllers sold everywhere will do the trick and they're cheap.The App. The app is easy enough to use and understand. It also has features telling you when to replace various parts of the machine. Brushes, filters, rollers, etc. It looks like these are on a timer and don't actually take into account the actual state of these parts, use your best judgement. You can also use the app to control this little guy like a RC car.Overall I'm pleased with this vacuum and I would buy it again. For the price you can't go wrong. However if you're thinking this will make it so you don't ever have to clean, you're wrong. This device will help supplement your cleaning schedule, not replace it.","Reviewed in the United States on November 25, 2019"

No, it does not do as good of a job as a standard vaccum cleaner, but it cleans up 95% of the mess both on my hard floors and my thick rugs.It goes from hard flooring to carpet seamlessly (though it's mush louder on the carpet). Since it only has random pathing, it does get stuck pretty often, but not super easily. I have had more problems with it not being able to find its base when the battery is low than I have with it actually getting stuck on things.The app is great!

We have 2 cats, a dog, and a toddler and only ran the Deebot every other day (while sweeping & vacuuming daily). We made sure to keep the debris bin emptied and took meticulous care of it, but one day we started getting an error message that said ""Main Brush Malfunction"". We replaced the main brush, thinking it was just old, but that didn't work. We cleaned the whole machine with no luck. We then started Googling and found this to be a common problem & found a video by someone showing how to solve the issue - by taking apart the main brush motor and cleaning it out for debris. My husband did so, put it back together, and we continued to get the same error message. At this point I contacted customer service and asked if we could purchase a replacement motor --- their response was that we were unfortunately outside of our 1-year warranty period and they don't sell replacement parts, but that there would be repair shops opening in the US in the coming years. They also sent a link to a video that ""others have found to be helpful"" - and it was the same video that we had already found on our own. We now have an expensive piece of equipment taking up room in our home that is useless, because it will not run.I'm extremely disappointed in the lack of quality of not only the product but also the support from Customer Service, and after discussing with other EcoVacs product owners have found this to be a common thread. We will not invest in another EcoVacs product and will highly discourage anyone else from doing the same. Waste of money, highly disappointing.","Reviewed in the United States on November 21, 2019"

It does not have any sort of intelligent learning or mapping and gets stuck a lot! It will get itself in areas that are virtually open (like under a desk)  but because of the radius it spins on it doesn't clear it enough to get out so it will run out of battery and die in random places. We have to search for it more days than we find it on the base. I have had several problems with this unit and errors. We have managed to get it working each time with the help of tech support. I had asked early on that the unit be replaced and I felt it had way too many issues but they always managed to help me get it operating so never replaced it. Just about 14 months of owning it and the thing is dead. We run it daily and do have two dogs but I feel the unit should have a longer life span than that. Because we are out of warranty, there is nothing they would do to help me at this point. This is rather infuriating!

The dust canister is always full after running it, so I know it's working.

Yesterday it starts to randomly stop in the middle of the floor. I check to see if it's caught or dirty. There's nothing there. I even get my replacement kit and replace the filters and brushes. The app continues to tell me ""main brush malfunction."" I contact their customer support. They have me run the machine without the brush. It still stops. He says it sounds like main motor is bad. Because I have had it 3 months past the warranty, I'm out of luck. He says they are supposed to be opening repair shops in the near future.... that's the most help I got. ""Too bad. Just wait.""

"1402","I really wanted to like this robotic cleaner.  I've had two robotic cleaners of the another brand and not only are they noisy, after about 2 years of daily use they start having problems, so I'm in the market for a new brand.The DEEBOT N795 is quiet and cleans VERY well, however only a small area.  As it states, the navigation technology is random so it never remembers the area or ventures very far.  We have a small open floor plan and I was hoping that it would cover the majority of the area, but it never left a 14x16 space where the dock was.  Also, when I moved it, it would go back to the area where the dock was.  I also had to program it 3 times before it worked as scheduled.The flip side is that it cleaned excellent. This machine has two side brushes, and a strong suction.  We have tile floors and in addition to everyday dirt, the DEEBOT seemed to have a swifter style that removed fine dust or prints left by shoes, dog paws, etc.  We were surprised at the amount of dirt & animal hair that it picked up in the small area it did clean.I returned it having to pay the shipping, but it was worth the demo because I am now hoping the the advanced model with Smart Navi is part of a Black Friday sale...I think it would be worth the money.","Reviewed in the United States on November 13, 2019"

When I finally asked to replace this unit they told me I was out of luck because the warranty period is one year from the purchase of the original defective unit.Overall, this product is good if it works.

It now does not hold a charge or work at all. I looked into contacting the company but it says the warranty is void if you replace the parts with ones bought off amazon.

This has been my most favorite purchase in a while. I have two Pomeranians and 3 toddlers who throw stuff everywhere. People coming in and out of my house nonstop. Lastly, I have white floors. I see absolutely everything on them. I am also compulsive about my floor being clean, I’ll spare you those details. I was frustrated at first that I couldn’t get it to connect to my iPhone app but my husband was able to do it on the android. Still don’t know why but at least it has a remote. I’m the queen of first world problems but I can live with the remote. After a few days I saw that my floor was not just clean but spotless. I have it run a few times a day and I can’t believe how much dirt is on the floor that I CANT see. Get yourself one of these especially if your a busy person.

In the beginning, this this was awesome! I loved how clean the floors were. We live in a 1500sqft ranch house, the only carpeted area are 2 out of 3 bedrooms but we keep the bedroom doors closed because of the dogs so the vacuum only runs in the hallway (wood laminate), kitchen (tile) and livingroom (wood laminate) which had a large area rug. The vacuum runs until the battery is low which is about 2 hours but it seemed to get stuck just about anywhere! We pretty much ended up having to vacuum proof our house so we didnt come home to a job half done, we even got rid of our large area rug in the living room. In fall 2018, the vacuum started malfunctioning so we had to contact customer service. There was no phone number to contact them so everything had to be done by email. They were very nice and replaced the vacuum since it was under warranty. Things seem to be ok, the vacuum was still getting stuck sometimes and it kind of became the norm for us to have to redirect it every once in a while. My biggest complaint with this new replacement is that it's been about a year since we recieved and it went from vacuuming our hallway, kitchen and livingroom for 2 hours to barely running for 30 mins before the battery drains and calls it quits! We only run the vacuum once a day at 7am and then its left to charge the rest of the day and night but even then the thing only runs for 30 mins tops and barely gets the hallway done. I'm ready to throw it in the trash and get us a roomba because it's become a piece of junk that sometimes just dies in the middle of a room.","Reviewed in the United States on November 10, 2019"

Finally ordered this and I am thrilled with it.  I have to clean it out quite often, so I know it's catching fur and dust. It's fairly quiet and, surprisingly, my skittish cat who hates the vacuum and plastic bags, is merely interested in it, usually watching from the bed.  I've been running it a couple of times a day in different parts of the house and it does fine with different surfaces.  (Right off the bat, it ran into a forgotten mouse glue trap and had to be rescued and cleaned.)  I've been frustrated that I haven't been able to hook it up with Alexa.

The company responded quickly and advise me how to return the The company responded quickly and advise me how to return the vacuum for another one. The replacement vacuum arrived promptly without us having to cover any of the shipping charges and has worked ever since. Now here are a few notes on how this vacuum performs.  On a hard surface floor like the one in the video attached to this review the vacuum does  Out standing. It picks up dog hair stray pieces of carpet and crumbs at or under the kitchen counter that my kids have left That the dog couldn't find. Obviously at this price point you are not going to get a robot vacuum that maps out your entire house and memorizes the floor plan and everywhere it has been. But even without those features it does one heck of a job. The little robot roams around the house making sure not to bump into anything or even fall down stairs if you have an open stairwell. In the video you will also see that if you have a very tall rug or shag  Rug it may even avoid it which is what we want for the type of rug you see in the video. It does romeu into our kids rooms who have shorter carpet and while it does seem to slow down a little bit it vacuums around their Room without any problemThe only real issue we've Had is that sometimes it gets stuck underneath our fridge, Which this may just be unique to our house or the type of fridge we have. Everything else where it can it will slip under and tables chairs and other furniture that sits up high enough. After about 45 minutes or an hour of letting it run you will want to make sure that you clean out The tray that collects everything it picks up.We have yet to, in over 2 years, had to untangle any hair or anything from the brush underneath the vacuum. The remote is simple and has commands on it such as vacuum the perimeter of your home or start in a circle or you can even control where the vacuum goes with directional buttons on the remote.Overall I am pretty satisfied with this robot vacuum.

"1451","LOVE THIS ROBOT!!!! We recently redid our floors and have only laminate downstairs. We also have 2 dogs and 3 kids so there was ALWAYS fur and dirt and crap all over the floor. We tried to sweep daily, but it was self defeating. I hated walking on our new lovely floor in bare feet because it was always dirty. Now that we have this wonderful little robot, I walk all over the house in my bare feet!!! It is so great! I can’t sing enough praises for it. It picks up all the dog hair and other little gritty things that just end up on the floor. Love it!It will NOT pick up dryer sheets that have fallen on the floor lol. It sometimes gets stuck but not very frequently. It’s amazing at Maneuvering around chair legs tables. It gets so close to the wall before turning. It’s fun to watch. I highly recommend this! I did read on another review that it is not good for big spaces or open floor plans. I disagree, our downstairs is huge (1700 sq ft) and all open (except to master bdrm) and this little thing works it all. It even finds its way into the master bathroom and leaves cute little vacuum tracks on the bathmats.If you were thinking of buying one, but weren’t sure...JUST GET IT!!! You will seriously wonder how you managed without it after! It’s so great.","Reviewed in the United States on November 7, 2019"

"1453","A lot quieter than my roomba. Cleans well - looks like it is comparable to the roomba meaning that it’s cleaning pattern is chaotic but it cleans well enough for me. We have a cat and she likes the deebot better. She is not a fan of the roomba because she doesn’t like the noise. I now have the roomba upstairs because it doesn’t get run as often and deebot downstairs. I did have an issue with it’s WiFi being detected but then I read online that the name of the 2g network needs to be less than 10-12 characters and the password needs to be all numbers. I renamed my 2g and made the password all numbers and just like that I was good to go. Of course it meant I had to either reentered or in some cases delete and rediscover several devices around the house that also uses the 2g. Connects well to Alexa - no issues so far - just enable the skill and good to go.","Reviewed in the United States on November 6, 2019"
"1454","Can’t recommend this unit. It doesn’t support 5.0 GHz Wifi. My U-Verse WiFi runs at both 2.4GHz and 5.0GHz. It’s supports devices that operate on either by automatically recognizing the systems frequency and establishing the connection that corresponds to the devices. You’d think the N79S would be sophisticated enough to work on this standard WI-FI system. Nope. DEEBOT tells you that you have to go in and separate your WI-FI frequencies by using two separate passwords. Why would I reconfigure my AT&T U-Verse so that a robotic vacuum can recognize the network? How about the DEEBOT engineers adjust their software to operate on standard home set-ups?","Reviewed in the United States on November 6, 2019"

I called the manufacturer customer service and they put me through the ringer - I’ve had to speak with 4 different reps over 4 days, had to send a video and a series of pictures just for them to need my warranty information... I’m pretty sure if something is broken right out of the box you shouldn’t need a warranty. Thankfully Amazon customer service took care of the issue for me. I’m getting a refund rather than exchange because I don’t want to have to deal with their customer service again.","Reviewed in the United States on November 6, 2019"
"1457","The price, oh my God, this thing cleans a 1000 square feet house in 30 minutes. It takes time to get your house set up for a single guy. In the floor you shouldn't have; clothes, cables, bags, etc. Also don't expect shining the first day, but you keep a daily routine and its improve with every pass.  The path is not 100% coverage per pass. The remote is simple, it charges simple. It does clean under bed (which I don't do a great job). It gets stuck around so its better to clean when you're in the house.  I don't like that get it stuck in standing fans base plate. It shouldn't.

I read a lot of reviews of different models and many people discuss issues with these devices going from hard floor to carpet and vice versa.  That is NOT the case with this deebot.  It seems to think it is an ATV and climbed on TOP of my shoes and got tangled in the lacing even after I had stashed all the lacing so it wouldn't suck it up from the floor.  oops.

"1466","Start with 90% with satisfaction then a year later 20%.  I bought it in August 2018, a little over 1 year now (Oct 2019).  It started very well with our wood floors, but never with carpet.  However, I was happy since I could not vacuum as often as I wish due to my disability.  I thought spending $20/month for vacuuming isn't bad, yet it lost the suction around 6 month.  The machine never had malfunctions or cause troubles.  Since it lost the suction, I move the the vacuum room by room after 1 hour use, pick up about 80% of dusts.  Battery runs over 3 hours from over night charge which has not change from the day one.  I love the idea but not sure I should jump on $500 robo-vacuum (seems investing in Miele is better if you spend that kind of $$)  or not to see if there is any difference in suction power loss over a year.","Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2019"

To the extent that it is being used, the surface where the sensors are located is scratching, so it usually loses some sensitivity and collides with objects; however, to solve this situation, it is best to keep very clean the surface where the sensors are.Very good product, I recommend it.","Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2019"

Runs about 90 minutes on auto, which is actually longer than I need, and then returns to its charging bay.

"1487","Day 1:  I received this bot vacuum today.  I had no great expectations for it.  I was looking for a bot vac to help keep the hardwoods less dusty, since I work full time and do not want to spend the end of each of my days cleaning the floor.  I expressly did not buy the Rooma since I heard it was so noisy.I do not have pets and our household has just two people who are pretty diligent about not tracking in lots of dirt, if that is possible.  After Amazon delivered today, I set it up, and actually read the instructions, and let it go do its thing.  I was pretty amused at watching it.  Tried out the auto setting, edge cleaning and single room cleaning.  I guess I have to admit that I assumed before I purchased it that it would ""mow the lawn"" when vacuuming.  Discovered pretty quickly, that was not the case.  It has a mind of its own.  When approaching table legs, chair legs, it would take off in an unexpected direction.  Many areas it never touched since it had such an erratic pattern of travel in all modes I tried.  I had to follow it and use the remote to redirect it back to the room and area I wanted it to clean - that probably took more time than it would have for me to vacuum manually.  Afterward, I looked further at some of the lower rated reviews here and agree with several people who only gave it a 3 star rating on several  points.  It is quiet.  It did pick up quite a lot of dirt, as evidenced when I emptied the dust bin.  However, I have, as many reviewers here mentioned, an open floor plan.  I attempted to block off areas to prevent the bot from entering, but that just confused it more.  It missed a lot of areas and wanted to go over certain areas again and again. Agree with the reviewers that the little guy cannot find HOME, I finally gave up and picked it up and put it on the base, and I tried this several times later with same results.  It appears on day 1 that it does a decent job for the price paid, but will not clean entire floor area since its track is not consistent.  Will update after future use if my opinion changes.  As I said at the get-go, I had no great expectations.  I did really want to be surprised.  But I am not, so expectation was accurate.","Reviewed in the United States on November 1, 2019"

(Cat litter, hair, spilled chips, fuzz, stuff like that.) I'll still need to use my upright vacuum once in a while to keep the place clean, but this is good for daily maintenance.I like that the Ecovac app tracks the life of replaceable parts, which includes the filter and the spinning brushes.Setting up with Alexa was pretty easy. Once you've followed the Quick Start instructions for connecting the vacuum to the internet (also simple, as long as you do exactly what it says), you can just ask Alexa to turn on Deebot. It won't, because it's not connected, but Alexa will tell you she's sending you a card on the Alexa app that will guide you through setup. Once you've followed that guide, you're all done. You can ask Alexa to run Deebot, or send it to the charger while it's running.So far, no complaints.","Reviewed in the United States on October 29, 2019"

The robot did good with just the remote for control for about 4 months, then ( i never set up auto cleaning ) it started turning on by itself at 1 am... bumping over floor transitions, i woke up thinking someone had broken into my house!! And then when it started having issues (stopping in the middle of the room acting like its stuck when clearly not stuck) it would stop and beep for what seemed like forever, again at 1 am... i started flipping it over upside down and leaving it on my couch when i went to bed. After a few months of that, it wouldn't go two feet without acting like the sky was falling so, i trashed it. The end.","Reviewed in the United States on October 27, 2019"
"1519","I’m satisfied after one year of use but be aware of the following:  my unit will start at midnight without having been scheduled and I have been unable to correct this other than power off unit. Also locating the charger base in a house is problematic because of the needed openness. Also the unit has difficulty finding the base unless it has direct line of sight. Also cleaning is a random walk so don’t expect it to hit every spot on the floor.My unit worked with Alexa and the app and the controller.I have wood laminate floors with some low carpets and it navigates those fine and no scratches on the wood. Deep pile area rugs not so good.When I need to run the unit I need to clear the floor of objects wires etc so automatic scheduling is not an issue for me.In summary it’s good for light vacuuming but don’t expect it to replace your canister Vac.","Reviewed in the United States on October 27, 2019"
"1520","I’ve had two of these models break down in a year. The customer service was awful. The person on the phone gave me attitude about requesting they fix the machine. He told me to bring it to a vacuum repair shop and pay for a repair out of pocket as there are no ecovac repair shops in the USA. It was fairly insane. When it worked, it was fine. It could never find home, and got stuck on rugs. I spent a little more and got an iroomba and I’m much happier.","Reviewed in the United States on October 27, 2019"
"1521","The price is pretty high for a random navigation robot. I had to return this product to get a deebot 900 which is only $245 with smart laser navigation and virtual boundaries using the deebot app.This robot is good for a small and a single room only. It will get stuck often and navigation inefficiently and miss a lot of spots.The good things are that this robot can schedule auto cleaning on the remote and the app. The suction is strong. That's about it. I personally don't like random navigation robot. It's pointless to have a robot which gets stuck and needs attention often and misses a lot of spots.","Reviewed in the United States on October 26, 2019"
"1522","Do yourself a favor and keep shopping.  When the Deebot N79s is working, it is great.  After 10 months our first bot's main brush malfunctioned.  After a two week back and forth with customer service, we finally received a replacement.  Awesome, right?!  Well, after 10 months (seriously) the replacement bot's main brush malfunctioned, and once again we are without a robot vac.  The company has informed us that we are no longer covered by the 1 year warranty.  That is correct -- even though we had to receive a replacement because the product malfunctioned twice with the SAME EXACT ISSUE -- our replacement bot did not come with a warranty. I'm sorry, but this is absurd.  We will begin shopping for another robot vacuum because we love having one around, but we will not purchase anything else from this company.","Reviewed in the United States on October 26, 2019"

I recieved an error message within the app once saying there was blockage somewhere, so I've tried cleaning out every possible area of deebot, even disassembling beyond what I probably should and still only cleans for 30 seconds then red light comes on and stops and beeps. Even when it did work,  it would constantly get stuck in a random location every night. It would only make it back to its charger about 10% of the time.","Reviewed in the United States on October 26, 2019"

There are a few spots in the house that give it problems: the wedge-shaped base of a floor fan, for instance. Every couple days we will find it stuck, plaintively beeping for help. Poor thing. Anyway, I'll pick him up and send it off in a different direction so he can finish his rounds. Sometimes he has trouble getting over a curled edge of an area rug and we will both look down from our television watching and offer words of encouragement. ""Come on, boy! You can do it!""

"1525","Deebot worked great at first. But slowly over time it has become a pain in the butt. I've reached out to customer service a couple times and their response is to clean it. I have decided it is quicker to just use my old upright vacuum than constantly have to hunt this thing down, clean it and start it up again.  It stops in the middle of the room, stops under beds and furniture, unobstructed. there is no reason it couldn't bump and then keep going but no, it just stops. It has rarely and I mean rarely docked itself. Every day is a scavenger hunt trying to find Deebot. I've cleaned it and cleaned it, replaced parts. It isn't even a year old and this has been going on for months. I would not personally recommend this product.

I first had problems three months into owning. I emailed the company and they were always very prompt into messaging me back but always had suggestions on what I could do to get this thing to work. I have needed up taking this things apart more times than I can count with no results. They finally say they will fix it and send it back. It took over three months to get my vacuum back and then it has the same problems a few months later and not they say the warrant is up even though I haven’t had the new one very long. Their last advice to me was to “ hit the vacuum very hard repeatedly until it works” what wonderful advice. Let’s face it all I have ever wanted to do was “hit this vacuum very hard” all along.

The empty one is me sweeping afterwards and moving the few pieces of furniture it cant go under.  Our Deebot is a life saver with our husky who goes in and out all day long.  It takes about 90 mins to run through 5 rooms and it is thorough!  It did used to ocassionally get stuck on rugs but we no longer have a rug in the area.  It's not too noisy but you can hear it zipping around.  I love the set and forget feature so it just runs every day and puts itself back to bed...you just have to remember to empty it.

This is the perfect mid day hair cleaner, it gets the majority of surface debris. Has a habit of getting stuck under some furniture with oystering on the bottom (large enough to enter at some points but then gets lower to the floor causing it to get stuck). It has never fallen down the stairs and is normally smart enough to find it's way out from under furniture. However, it will find any small kids sock or rope dog toy to suffocate on necessitating a rescue. My only real comment is that it's not a super deep clean on thick rugs, so dont expect to never vacuum. As a twice daily auto cleaner it's hard to beat and keeps the house looking less like the dog is purposely shedding.After two months I had to replace the sweepers.

I know it’s not totally programmable but in auto mode it seems now to go more over the same areas again and again then all over.

So, I finally pulled it out and began using it.  The program set up was easy, and it worked awesome at picking up dust, hair, debris, and etc.  I changed the filters, brushes, and cleaned out the collection bucket on schedule, as it cleaned my house once per day.  It seemed to learn the in and outs of my house.  Around January of 2019 it stopped working, so I picked it up to inspect the bottom and had found that the rubber tread of the wheels had torn or cracked then torn.  I contacted the EvoVac customer service and they told me to send it back and they would replace with a new unit free of charge.  So, I sent it back, and waited for my new vacuum to come.  Once it arrived I reset it up, and we were off and running again!!!  It is now October 2019, and I turned it over again to do regular maintenance on it such as the filter, and brushes and noticed that one track had cracked and fallen apart again.  I love this machine for everything else, but now I have to contact the manufacturer again in regards to the wheels.  It appears to be a design flaw and that once the rubber cracks and breaks off you can not just order a new track to replace it.  This sucks!!!  I would really love to give this a 5 star, but the treads keep wearing out after about 6 or so months, and there is no way at this time to simply replace them without returning the whole unit.I will write another update once I get in touch with the manufacturer in regards to returning the item for a new one, yet again...……  This seems to be a major design flaw with this model, so keep this in mind when you purchase.

Prior to this, it was great - picked up hair and light debris (would not be good for anything heavy). It was the perfect assistant to the full-time vacuum, making it easier to clean the floor in less time.Approximately nine months into using the Deebot, it started going off on it's own waking up the entire household at midnight each night.

Long story short, we have jumped through a million (slight exaggeration) hoops -- removed the app from our phone, unplugged the charger, took out batteries, reset the unit, took out batteries from the remote....everything they told us to do.....AND NOTHING HAS WORKED. Not only is it a little disturbing that this machine goes off by itself for some unknown reason, it is also incredibly frustrating that we have been in almost daily contact for the last month trying to remedy the problem. It could have been a forever relationship, but at this point it's time for this romance to come to an end.....it's not me, it's you! Stop turning on when you are unplugged and disconnected!

If you want to run it manually every time it’s not a big deal; but if you want a set it and forget vacuuming solution this isn’t the one.Maybe they can release a firmware update that addresses this.","Reviewed in the United States on October 12, 2019"

Then it suddenly just started running for a few mins then stopping & flashing the red error light. I've always maintained it, changed the filters, cleaned them, etc - so I have no idea why it stopped working. Of course it's a few months outside of the service eligibility window. Now I'm understanding why people will pay $200 more for a name-brand - they last much longer. This one only last 9 months.","Reviewed in the United States on October 11, 2019"

"1588","We have had the product for a little over a year. Our DeeBot ""Dusty"" as we know him has done a pretty good job until now. He isn't great on our bedroom carpet because its kind of thick but he handles all the other rooms of the house quite well. The problem is recently Dusty started randomly beeping. He makes a series of Beeps on his charger quite loudly. He beeps 4 times quickly then again and then one more time. It is loud and annoying and we don't know why. We looked it up and some people say it is an issue with the battery some say it is the collision sensors. We changed the brushes, cleaned the sensors, anything we could do to help him. Still no luck . When I look up my order on Amazon it says the product support window closed 10 months ago. So not sure what that means. If you buy I guess purchase a protection plan. If the manufacturer sees this and is willing to help us figure it out we would be happy to raise to 5 stars if you can help us get this issue resolved.","Reviewed in the United States on October 10, 2019"
"1589","This Bot has outperformed Its reviews.  I have 2 dogs and a cat. I was vacuuming and dusting 3 times a week. I have a cheap vacu-bot now but it was no help and I had to manually charge it which I hated. I now only dust every 2 weeks and spot vacuum, under and behind things the bot can't get to, every 2.5 to 3 weeks as needed.  I tell Alexa to start cleaning and off it goes. When finished, about 90 min on low suction or 60 min on high, it flawlessly docks and charges. The N79S has only missed docking twice and only because I forgot to move a plush carpet first. Just make sure you don't hide it in a dark corner or down a small hallway, needs to be a bit in the open for the bot to see it. When it needs to charge it will wander a bit, enough that you may think its lost but, give it a chance! It will find the base. The edge feature is awesome. Will edge clean the entire house in under 30 minutes. The over sized collection bin is great. Holds a ton of fur. If it gets stuck under a table it seems to go into edge cleaning and always finds it's way out. The bin, brushes and filters are very easy to clean and change when needed. And, customer service is second to none! I sent an email after closing time and they responded back in less than 5 minutes to take care of a small problem. Oh, and on high, the bot likes to move some throw rugs around and even flip the over from time to time but, they are no problem for it. You need this Bot if you hate cleaning. Does a remarkable job and is affordable to boot.","Reviewed in the United States on October 10, 2019"

We named it Mr. BeauregardIt does a fairly good job. It bumbles around bouncing off of things until it gets most of the house clean. I have used my push broom afterwards and there is minimal hair left. The main downside is that it doesn't have mapping and so sometimes it will spend a really long time doing the same room over and over. It also periodically gets stuck trying to get into the kitchen and bathroom because there is a hump.I like the N79S, but I think if I were to purchase another robot vacuum, I would get one with mapping capabilities to make the cleaning more efficient.","Reviewed in the United States on October 8, 2019"

"1613","I didn't enable  Alexa so I can't speak to that.  Some of the negative reviews seem to be expecting a lot out of this little vac.  It cleans fine for what I expect of it.  I usually run it once between cleaning lady visits to get surface stuff- crumbs and such.  Or when the exposed wood floor is gritty.  It goes under the furniture which helps cut down on dust bunnies.  The dust chamber is small so if I'm running it over the whole (Ranch) house I need to dump it frequently. It's quirky.  It really does need to be supervised.  I would never let it run while I'm not here.  It likes pick up cords and run around with them. It can pull lamps off if I don't move the cord. It likes to bully the stools in the kitchen and needs to be redirected.  We have a lot of small and large area rugs.  I don't have a problem with it changing from wood to rugs, but it sometimes likes to sit and chew on the edge of a rug.  One review said it can't find it's home base.  I have the opposite problem- it doesn't like to be too far away from the base.  If I want it to clean in one part of the house, I have to shut the doors to rooms in the part where the charger is or it will not go to the other parts of the house.For the price, it's fine.  It does what I bought it to do- light cleaning of surfaces between regular cleanings.","Reviewed in the United States on October 5, 2019"
"1614","Okay so I've had this guy, Vlad the Inhaler, for about a year and here is my take:1. He does pick up a lot of dirt. The first week I had to empty him everyday. I don't have pets or children and vacuumed weekly. I didn't think my floors were so dirty. They are.2. You have to pick up your house before you let your robot vacuum. Vlad has picked up a lot of things, especially phone cords.3. Your robot will get stuck in the most random places. For sure under your couch, possibly your air conditioning grate, your kitchen rug.4. Run your vacuum while you're home so you can rescue 'em.5. You need to run your robot at least five days a week to vacuum your house. This little guy uses a random pattern, so it takes a few days to cover your entire floor.6. I had him for about 10 months before having to replace the brushes and filter.TL;DR good intro robot vac, does the job, you should be home when he rune so you can rescue him when he gets stuck.","Reviewed in the United States on October 4, 2019"

Our Ecovacs cruises the house when you push the start button and you only have to remember to empty the dustbin in it every hour of operation.

The charge lasts almost 2 hours.Now, that said, this vacuum does have the auto setting where you can program your Deebot to run at a specific time of day. We initially had this setup for Deebo to run, every night at 830pmFor about a week, this setting was great. Then we decided we wanted to remove it and have it just run when we choose / push the auto button.Deebo feels otherwise. We followed the settings to remove the auto run and reboot. Deebo still runs every night at 830. It wont turn off. So now he just does whatever he wants each night.

WITH ONE MAJOR EXCEPTION - this thing will randomly turn on in the middle of the night and start cleaning. It's not IF it does this - it's when.  The Manufacturer gave me a pretty extensive set on instructions I should follow to eliminate this from happening. None of them worked. The trick is to program its internal clock to a cleaning schedule that works for you. But if you set the time accurately - it will turn on at midnight, every night, all the time.

"1664","I love this vacuum.  I use it on hardwood, laminate, and rugs.  I've tried it on the carpeted surfaces upstairs but it's just not worth it as it doesn't do that great of a job on anything that is above very low pile.  As other reviews say, it does have some trouble finding it's home base if it's not in a very obvious location.  It took a few tries to find the best place to stage the charger so that it can find it's home and in the time that it didn't go home, it's not a big deal to pick it up and put it back on the charger.I have a short hair dog and it picks up his hair no problem - sometimes it picks up marbles if the kids don't get every last one before we run it.  It's excellent at picking up sand and other small debris.  Sometimes it will just kick things out of the way instead of picking it up with the sweepers but it's minimal.I love this vacuum.  I just have to pick up and push start, not pick up all the things and then push the vacuum around (I do still push the Miele around about once a month to do the corners and behind things).Well worth the money.","Reviewed in the United States on September 25, 2019"

But this time the answer I got from customer service is: your product has no longer warranty, I’m sorry.The only solution I get is to buy a new product, since they don’t even repair their products.So I definitely don’t recommend this product, it will only last 8-9 months.

Yes you have to clean it out regularly. It's not super quiet but it sure does get the job done. We barely have to use a regular vacuum anymore. It can become confused on busy pattern rugs. It can get hung up on floor vents it thinks they are stairs and stops to avoid falling down. It is set to run twice a day. We have opted for a new RV now with mapping the old RV will now do our upstairs a few times a week.

"1700","This product originally was exactly what I was looking for: it was efficient, effective, and good for every day cleaning. I also picked it up during a nice winter sale which sweetened the deal even more. For a young couple without kids or pets, it was a good fit.However, it wasn't long before I found myself growing frustrated with it: in areas in which it had previously navigated without issue, it started to get lost and stuck and beep noisily at me in confusion. I used to be able to let it run while I was out of the house and it could easily navigate rooms and between hardwood and carpeted surfaces, but it became commonplace to find it stuck under chairs, desks, beds, really any furniture at all.The final straw was when I started to notice that my little Deebot would only run for about ten seconds before it would stop completely and complain that it had encountered an obstacle, but without one in sight. It turns out this is a common issue: a brush malfunction of any sort will stop this vacuum dead in its tracks. It will plant itself down and adamantly refuse to work after ten whole seconds.Mind you, I've only had the Deebot for a year; 16 months to be exact. I did not expect it would simply give out on me after a year's time. And of course, it would give up after the one year warranty expired.I get it: robot vacuums are expensive pieces of machinery and software. To get one at a good deal, you have to expect cost cutting measures somewhere. But I'm disappointed in its longevity; why does a single brush malfunction shut it down completely?Bottom line: if you want something that will work well for a time and you don't have a great deal of furniture, this is a nice find during a sale. If you want something that you won't have to replace and repurchase year after year, look elsewhere.","Reviewed in the United States on September 19, 2019"

We have three stories, three long haired pets (2 dogs and a cat), 5 people, and most of us work from home. It’s chaos trying to keep the floors clean.I thought this would be a nice to have but it’s been a lifesaver. I turn it on in the morning on one floor, and take it with me upstairs in the afternoon. It tackles oak hardwood floors, ceramic tile, stone, rugs, AND thick carpet. We only have to rescue it when it gets stuck under the fridge occasionally.

It does a way better job at picking up cat hair than I ever expected! It's hard to get the cat litter from the carpet, but that's okay. I don't expect ""expensive German vacuum"" quality from a robot. But it does a great job at picking up the big pieces and keeping things livable on a daily basis. Runs just about an hour before battery is dead and goes back to her bed (charging port). She does consistently get stuck at the top of the stairs which is frustrating- wheel gets stuck over the edge of the stairs and she can't pull herself back up.  But overall, I'd highly recommend!Oh, one last tip - if you have bedroom doors and you want her to clean the room, use a doorstop to keep the door open. Several times she has accidentally locked herself in a room by going behind the door and pushing it closed.I'm hoping to start a breeding program with my brother's Bender...

It does an okay job in picking up loose dust and pet hair, but sub-par when trying to pick up over a low-pile carpet. I'm not expecting this device to do a deep, thorough cleaning so I guess this level of efficiency is tolerable. My main gripe with this device is that it's ""dumb."" Meaning the senors are awful and it constantly runs into and bangs into walls a furniture. It actually ran into a very large floor mirror we had leaning against a wall causing it to crash to the floor. I really expected the device senors to work better on avoiding crashing into things. The baseboards of my apartment has marks all along them showing the spots where this robo-vac has crashed into them.

It's very easy to setup and get it connected to Wi-Fi.  The app is very easy to use although it just seems a lot easier to just push that button on the robot itself.Now don't get me wrong, it gets ""stuck"" sometimes (a lot if you have cords or cables lying around.  So you're going to need to sort of ""robot proof"" the environment.  I close my door to the bathroom as it seems to always get stuck under the cabinet sink.  I make sure there isn't loose cables/wires/etc that it can get tangle with.  Once you have things situated, the cleaning process is a breeze and very little maintenance required (other than to empty the container)  Keep in mind you are going to need to replace the cleaner parts (main brush/side brushes, and filters) but they're all very simple to do.After a year, I ran into an issue where the robot was on strike (it'll spin around then just stops and makes two beeps)  I've worked with support (great customer service by the way) and in the end they replaced the unit even though it was definitely out of their 1 year warranty (maybe by a week or so)  So they stand by their product no worries there.","Reviewed in the United States on September 17, 2019"

"1721","Our Ecovac cleaned well until one day it decided not to clean anymore. It was having the ""main brush malfunction"" that so many other reviewers have mentioned. We removed the main brush and cleaned it, but this did not solve the problem. We then contacted customer service. The person I spoke to did not seem to know a lot about this model, but she eventually insisted we need a new brush. So we spent $30 to purchase the ""replacement kit"" directly from Ecovacs. Once that arrived we put the new brush in, and we are still getting the same error!! For a unit that costs between $150 and $200 this should last more than 9 months without any issues. We are confident that this problem is not a brush issue, but a motor or computer issue within the unit. Seeing so many people have complained about the same problem, this is a known issue to Ecovacs, and they should fix the issue once and for all.","Reviewed in the United States on September 15, 2019"

We can literally hear when it starts running upstairs. It gets stuck on cords (like to a fan or lamp) all the time and then just stays there until it dies. Our internet speed is basically too fast for it to even connect to. So the app is basically useless as it always shows the bot is “offline”. It bumps into things and then completely changes direction so it can run until it dies and still miss half the room.","Reviewed in the United States on September 15, 2019"

"1724","I have one dog. My flooring is mostly wood, with low pile carpeting in some rooms. I have never owned a robot vacuum before, so I cannot compare this to other models or brands.After reading reviews, my expectation was that I would still need to dust mop or vacuum by hand regularly. Instead, Deebot handles most of the vacuuming. I occasionally pull furniture out from the wall and dust behind it.  I am not the world's keenest house cleaner; your expectations may be more rigorous.I did have a period where I could not get the Deebot to run. When I examined it closely, I saw that the bumper was stuck beneath a small tab. This made it inflexible, and since the bumper is its essential sensing tool, it could not run that way. I popped the bumper back above the tab. It ran fine after that. I think I displaced the bumper by picking up the unit one handed from the front. Now I lift it with both hands from behind.The Deebot operates randomly, but left to its own devices, it will do thorough job of vacuuming. It excels at getting pet hair from the edges of carpeting. Nice people live with their floors Deebot-ready, but I have to spend a few minutes patroling the area before vacuuming. Move or block areas with electrical cords, pick up large debris, pet toys and whatnot. Shut doors or block hallways to keep Deebot out. Then put your feet up with a good book while Deebot does your work for you.You should expect to empty the small dust bin a couple times in the course of an hour in very dusty rooms. If you run it regularly, you will only need to empty it at the end of its cycle.Buy it on sale. It is a fine household tool for the money.","Reviewed in the United States on September 15, 2019"

"1726","This robot vacuum is amazing. I was amazed at the efficiency the N79S delivered. I was nervous at first whether or not it would clean the whole room, but after leaving and coming back, it was apparent that no spot was missed. Be aware that battery time will be affected by the floor. Thicker carpet may drain the battery in about 45 minutes, whereas, hard floors will do the expected time or more. I would also recommend getting a kitchen mat to put the charger on otherwise the deebot will not properly dock. Truth be told, after emptying the bin, I was surprised to see how much it picked up that my regular vacuum didn't. This robot vacuum delivers both in quality and price. Definitely not a 4 star vacuum but rather a 5 star.","Reviewed in the United States on September 15, 2019"

"1732","After comparing dozens of brands and models, I settled on this particular robot vacuum given the performance to price ratio reviews attributed to it. While this vacuum does a good job at picking up dirt, the programming is completely insane to the point of randomly zigzagging across a room with no logical pattern of any kind and no clearly organized way of covering the entirety of a room. Furthermore, I have found that it takes 10-15 minutes with suction turned off to find its dock and only succeeds in doing so about 30% of the time before it dies. Customer support says that moving the dock to another location can make a huge difference, however, I have tried placing mine where there is clear space around it of several feet and it still struggles by going into up to three other rooms before even finding the right room. Even when it does find the correct room, it will often leave it several times for others before eventually coming back.It's worth noting that while this is happening, it is in ""find dock"" mode, so the vacuum function is effectively off, which makes it clear that it is simply incompetent, rather than actually cleaning more before returning.Update: I’ve had it for about six months now and the reason I kept it is that I placed about 38 pieces of tissue throughout the house. All were picked up over 1-2 runs. The randomness may be frustrating, but it works. I also received a partial refund for the inconvenience by someone who claims to be with amazon after-sale support, so I’ve improved the review for customer satisfaction purposes.","Reviewed in the United States on September 14, 2019"
"1733","If you look at the prior 6 reviews, 4 mention the Deebot breaking within a few months. That was my experience as well.My first Deebot had issues with the main brush after 6 months. Despite following the manual and working with customer support, there was no saving it and it needed to be replaced. Fortunately, it was under warranty and they replaced it.6-7 months later, I ran into the same issue with the side brush. At this point, it was out of warranty so I was told I was out of luck but they might be opening a repair center in the future.Overall, the quality was poor and the fact that they break so often seems dishonest. Surprised that this was the Amazon's choice cleaning bot.","Reviewed in the United States on September 14, 2019"

It's thin, and has great clearance under most of the furniture in my house. It managed to pick up a ton of dust, even after I had just swept two days ago. It even managed to find and pick up a stay pencil! The normal operating mode is not nearly as loud as some of the Roombas I've been around, which was a pleasant surprise. I can't speak for the noise level of the ""max"" setting, though I can say I have not had any need for it either. While I've never owned a Roomba myself, I've house sat for people who have.

I didn't want to have to declutter every day just to run it.  Decided I would give it a try to see if it could work as-is and have been really happy with the result.  I setup a cleaning schedule and this thing just takes off every day and does it's thing.  I have a mix of carpet and hardware floors, pets, and kids junk all over - as well as area rugs and it navigates all of them with no trouble.  It's not going to deep clean, but a light cleaning every day goes a long way.  I just have to empty the collection container which only takes a few seconds.It doesn't always find it's way back to the charging base and will occasionally get stuck on a chord or cable, but I'm pretty impressed it works as well as it does.  It requires almost zero effort from me... works in a real house (clutter and obstacles abound) and gets it done.  We're busy and this little dude helps clean up every day with no complaints.","Reviewed in the United States on September 5, 2019"

"1795","I loved this product when I first purchased. Now, 9 months later, I’m not so happy. It SLAMS into all furniture and baseboards. I have cleaned it per the advice on internet to make sure the sensor isn’t blocked, but it still runs into everything. The other disappointment is that it doesn’t go in other rooms. My house is only 1200 sq ft. It used to go to all the rooms and even under the beds, now it just stays in the same room for 90 minutes! It seems it has developed a pattern and is no longer random. It still cleans that one room like a champ, but I’d really like for it to cover the whole area like it used to do.","Reviewed in the United States on September 4, 2019"
"1796","It was awesome! We woke up every morning and the vacuum fairy had already been, the floors were spotless (although we called it Seamus... because its more like its being driven by a drunk leprechaun. There's an 80% chance it passed out in the middle of the floor before making back to the charger or got stuck under something).Then we changed our Wifi... which means it lost its connection to Alexa. The app is completely useless as far as re-configuring wifi, the only way to do it is to delete the bot and reinstall it as a new bot... and step 2 or 3 asks you to press a button on the remote. We always used Alexa, or relied on the preset schedule... we haven't seen the remote for years.Long story short, because we cant find the remote, we cant connect it to the new WiFi and it doesnt connect to Alexa, it's now useless. Loved it so much that we're looking into getting another one, another brand though, because its completely ridiculous that we have to buy a whole new vacuum because we cant find the remote.","Reviewed in the United States on September 3, 2019"

"1799","I bought this little guy for the pet hair on my wood floors -they drive me insane. I have seen an improvement both in my floors and allergies. I will own one of these for the rest of my life. It's so nice to just come home to clean floors everyday. Sweeping is one less thing to worry about and the payment plan makes it way worth the investment.EDIT: I used to run this when I wasn't home so I could come back to clean floors. While that was nice, I didn't notice what was actually going on. Now that I work from home, I can see that it slams into my dining table and chairs and it makes me CRINGE. It's good about avoiding walls but it can't sense thin, standing objects like chair legs, and it goes full-speed into them. I know the more expensive versions have anti-collision for this specifically but I think at the very least, all the models should have this. I don't need the fancy stuff like mapping my house but I really don't appreciate the damage to my furniture it's making.","Reviewed in the United States on September 3, 2019"

"1804","Vacuum  works fine for about 60 minutes but then robot cannot find home for another 30+ minutes. I like the periphery setting and it works well on that setting. I have a large room with kitchen in an open floor plan and battery is gone after two rounds of periphery cleaning. I don't know if entire room is cleaned in one go because there's no map feature to show what area was cleaned. iPhone app is very basic. I do have to walk around and close bathroom doors, remove area rugs otherwise robot gets stuck. If I select a single room/area clean setting, there's no way to keep in one area, it wanders off. Another drawback - it gets stuck under bar stools and may take 1-2+ minutes to get out of the bar stool. I see the robot take small angle turns and try to get out but right when it is about to be free, it will take a larger angle turn, get stuck and then repeat the cycle all over again. I have a 39 second video of it stuck under a chair that is close to the wall and robot did the same turns for 2+ minutes. I hope that there's a software update that gets released to add more features.","Reviewed in the United States on September 2, 2019"

I have various spare parts from several other robotic vacuum cleaners, but the internal electronics on this died. In buying these cleaners, you have to bear in mind that they are extremely fragile critters and a single roll down the stairs or pet accident will ruin them. For that reason, the last couple that I have purchased are the mid-quality Chinese-branded -- like ""Deebot."" Even with lots of TLC (which I provided), do not expect lots of longevity from a ""Deebot.""

That has never happened with the Roomba.  I wish I hadn’t had waste my money on this one.  I have 2 large dogs and all tile floor.  The hair would tangle and you had to be home to unclog it.

However the app recently updated and it now required access to unnecessary permissions on the phone to work.  It now requires access to your phones IMEI and the phone itself as if it needed to make calls.  ECOVACS, why does a wi-fi vacuum need access to these permissions?  This is starting to encroach into PII territory.  So now I have a choice to provide you unnecessary personal information or my vacuum is crippled.

The spin brushes somewhat help but ends of pushing dirt under couches and corners.As for customer service they receive a 1 star.

"1813","I bought this vacuum to use on our luxury vinyl flooring. We have two dogs, one being an American Eskimo that leaves his fluffy fur around the house and other dog is a Morkie which she doesn't shed much. I have it programmed to run at 9 am daily and it does a great job on our 950 sq ft home. It goes over our one transition and avoids the steps without a problem. Since this level is all vinyl - it runs over 2 hours before it returns to its base. We empty the container everyday and it always has stuff in it - mostly the white fluffy fur. The only thing I don't like about it is that it bumps into my side tables (which are fairly light) and moves them a bit, so every day I have to straighten them out. We are going to try and add some small weights to the table in hopes that will help. Also, we have a recliner that plugs in - it gets hung up on the cord, which is a bummer. I just have made it a habit every morning to empty the container, unplug the recliner and put our two end tables up before I leave for the day and then put them back when I am home. This is the only reason why I gave it four stars - it would be perfect five stars if I didn't have to move these few items. However, I will say I do plan on buying another for our lower level at some point, just waiting for a sale.","Reviewed in the United States on September 1, 2019"

Ecovacs said that they do not offer such a warranty. I spent more time trying to trouble shoot the machine that it became quicker for me to pick up a broom. The customer service support was also absolutely terrible. They started off being super responsive, but once their troubleshooting strategies did not work for my vacuum and I discussed replacement, they stopped responding to me.

Maybe Ecovacs have evolved but I wouldn't buy it again.","Reviewed in the United States on August 24, 2019"
"1863","Loved it right out of the box.  Cleaned hardwoods and dog hair daily and did a good job.  It never performed the same once the original parts had to be replaced.  You cant get replacement brushes and such from the manufacturer.  You have to get knock off parts that are second rate from other sources.  Once the infrared sensors fail, the deebot bumps into everything, performs erratically, and gets stuck under furniture.","Reviewed in the United States on August 24, 2019"
"1864","I don’t know why I waited so long to get a robotic vacuum. I love it. At first it lagged a bit to find its way back to charger but after a couple of times it resolves.","Reviewed in the United States on August 24, 2019"
"1865","The Ecovacs Deebot N79S has had its ups and downs with us over the 15 months we have owned it. Overall, we are extremely unhappy with this purchase. We bought the product in June of 2018. By August of 2019, it now sits as a floor decoration, unable to be used. As we are outside of our warranty window by 3 months, there is nothing that Ecovacs can do to help us resolve the issue. Now don't get me wrong, I am not expecting to be the exception to the warranty rules - our warranty expired, and that is that. What is frustrating is that 3 months after our warranty expired, a product we spent $250 on is now unusable. That is, in my opinion, unacceptable.Our main problem with the robot is that after 15 months, it will not run for more than 5 minutes before stopping, in the middle of the room, displaying a ""Main Brush Malfunction"" on the app. I have replaced the main brush, the filters, and the side brushes, I have reset the robot, and I have tried removing the main brush to see if it runs without it, all with no luck - the robot continues to only run for 5 minutes before displaying the error, telling me that it is probably not the main brush that is problematic but something else entirely. The app does not provide a clear understanding of what that error is, leaving me helpless when trying to diagnose the problem. I contacted Ecovacs Customer Service, where after I told them everything I did (i.e. replace, remove and reset), they asked me to the EXACT same things, multiple times as their customer service apparently does not communicate between their representatives. One asked me to remove the main brush, and then two replies later, with two other representatives, I'm told to remove the brush again.... Their solution at the end of the day was, ""Sorry - you are out of warranty, there is nothing we can do"". I have no problem paying to get it fixed, but it would be nice if their Customer Service could do a better job helping me diagnose the problem. Sure, they said I could wait until their repair shop center was open, but they didn't give me any idea of when that could happen. So now I sit with a robot that does not work.Pros:- When it worked, it worked great. The variable suction (controllable from the app) was fantastic. It did a good job cleaning the room it was in.- Customer services replied promptly and was helpful (enough). See below for additional.Cons:- Rarely would we be able to run the Deebot without some malfunction. Whether it is that the robot got stuck under a piece of furniture, or it went off a rug at just the right angle that the drop sensor malfunctioned, rarely would it actually make it back to the docking station without help. I think this is one of the biggest complaints that we have about this Deebot. I should not have to ""robot"" proof my home for the robot to function. A rug should not cause the robot to malfunction. And either it needs to be a little taller or a little smaller so that it does not get stuck under regular furniture.- Errors on the app were unspecific and hard to track down. A ""main brush malfunction"" was actually something completely different and untraceable.- Customer service, though responsive, was not super great. I submitted a complaint online, received a response in a timely fashion, replied, and received a response from a completely different person, asking the same questions I had just answered. This happened regularly. I received questions that I had already answered, being bounced from person to person until I was told that I was basically out of luck.- The robot also had a bunch of issues getting stuck in the same room, or going back to the same area over and over and over again. Now I understand this is not a human and thus has no inclination of what room it is in. But it regularly would be turning circles in our halfway, going back and forth, over and over again. It would be nice if it could recognize that it has spent 30 minutes in the same area, and track the wall to get out of the room.- There was inconsistency with the wall sensors. There were times that it would slowly approach the wall, before stopping and turning around. Then there were times when it would full on plow into the wall, slamming hard, and then turning around. Luckily, it never damaged the wall, but the inconsistency seemed a bit odd.Overall, we would not recommend this product to anyone. For the $250 price tag, it its a piece of junk. The ONLY reason I give it 1 star is that it did work for about a year before it became a wonderful room decoration.","Reviewed in the United States on August 24, 2019"
"1866","I love that it can be automatically programmed to run on it's own. I set it daily (and make sure cat toys are picked up) and clean it weekly easily with the tools that came with it.

Also comes with a remote if you don’t care to download the app or you don’t have a smart phone. The only downside is it lacks the ability to create barriers so if that is nessary in your home this one won’t work, I normally just put an object in the path that I don’t want it to go or simply close the door.

The app is not set up for the model I bought even though it is advertised as having the app capability which is one of the major features that made me purchase. My bot even came with a card telling me to download the app, but once in the app there is no option for my model.

However they removed the old software and replaced it with new software that requires access to your photos, contacts, camera, phone call logs, and IMEI.  This is highly invasive and sketchy.  Now I can't read consumables or battery life, or modify the suction power without giving them full access rights to my life.  There's zero excuse for this.The one time I did have an issue with the actual vacuum hardware (stuck bumper contact sensor) they brushed me off saying ""clean the bumper lens""Also the device likes to phone home every once in a while without your consent to an IP of mysterious origin.

"1885","I purchased the Ecovac in November to run in different zones than my 7 year old Roomba.I was shocked that the Ecovac did pick up dust/lint my Roomba missed. I had a battery issue from the start. It ran a good 2 hours on standard vac vs max.I started to notice it started to lose 5 then 10 and eventually 20 min over time.I broke and injured my toe in late July. I ran the Ecovac everyday along with my Roomba in approximately 1200 sq ft of hardwood and tile.I've bought replacement parts and always clean the vacuum after it runs.Two weeks ago I pushed the button for the vacuum to run and it would go about 1-2 feet and beep red. After troubleshooting it myself I called customer support.They led me through a few steps and then advised me to take a few pictures, attach my original invoice and address.They sent me a return label to drop off at a local UPS store. I had to provide a box and return everything including the base charger and remote.I emailed them everyday after I dropped it off. It took about 8 business days to receive a brand new vacuum.It was in a brand new box and packaged the exact same way when I originally ordered it.I saw a deal for this vacuum yesterday and contemplated buying one or two additional Ecovac's for convenience.I emailed CS this morning to double check the warranty.They said my warranty is exactly a year from the original date of purchase.My iRobot Roomba is 7 years old. I've replaced the battery once, additional tools a few times.The motor burned out within nine months of my original purchase. I ran it every day when I first received it then it was about 2 or 3 timesstarted running guarantees their vacuum's and ones that last longer. I've owned a Roomba for 8 years. I've  replaced the battery once and miscellaneous parts 3-4 times.The reason for my extensive review is the Ecovac is a budget robot vacuum but once the motor burns, you are out of luck after one year of purchase.","Reviewed in the United States on August 21, 2019"

But sure enough, they replaced it and shipped a new one, no hassles.The new one was noticeably louder...to the point where you couldn't watch TV while it was on, and even running it at night while you went to bed was too much.  It would bang as it went over the seems in the ceramic tile or over flooring transitions, or bumped into chairs and things.  But still...better than manually sweeping, right?Then, 10 months later, it started beeping.  4 beeps, 5 times.  Went though online FAQs, cleaned it all out.  No change.Even when it charged on the dock.  4 beeps, 5 times.  Every minute or two.  Constantly.Finally contacted technical support.  They troubleshot with me over email...then finally, informed me that there was no more warranty since the original purchase was in 2017.Both Deebots lasted less than a year.I understand it's got a lot of moving parts and electronics...maybe it's just too much to ask for a machine like this to last with every day use at an affordable price point.Don't expect it to last!","Reviewed in the United States on August 20, 2019"

"1927","Great smart cleaning bot but if you have high leveled carpet or objects should not pushed around not recommended. It has so many features but I am not going to list all them out because simply you are not going to use them all.I use the app most of the time. You can manage, schedule, and control them with your app. You can think of your phone as remote controller (actual remote controller is included as well) But the best part is you can control your bot so far away from your home. When I work, I press one button to operation it's own and it will automatically find their charging station when their battery is low. (well... you might already know.)

Otherwise, Deebot will vacuum all the dust and throw back out as the way they go...","Reviewed in the United States on August 15, 2019"

"1931","I really wanted to like this, but it's proving harder and harder. First off, it has a hard time getting over the tiny little incline to get into my bathroom that both of my old robot vacuums were able to handle with ease. I have to manually put it in there, which obviously is an issue if I'm not home when it's in use. I can, however, overlook that, as it's just a small part of my apartment.My real issue is that it is again banging into everything (doors, walls, furniture, etc). I've had it for  only a little over six months and have replaced it once already for this. It seems to work fine for two or three months, then the issues come back. The first time it started happening, they recommended I give it a full clean and use car headlight cleaner on the sensor. That worked for a day or two, then the problems persisted. I tried it again this time, and the issues have only gotten worse.Robot vacuums should not have these issues, especially after only a few months. I only run it twice a week, and clean the tray after every use.Again, I really wanted to like this vacuum, but that's proven more and more difficult. This is why I take the warranties out on these things.Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this item, despite its otherwise good reviews.","Reviewed in the United States on August 15, 2019"

Well we had it running on a schedule for about a month now and everything was good. If you have reclining furniture with a gap at the bottom then it's going to get stuck. Its suppose to sense objects so it can prevent from running into it but it's a hit or miss. (My kids get a kick out of it though) as far as the suction and pick up goes it does the job. It picks up hair and snack crumbs but you kind of have to guide it. It doesn't have a mapping system so it is random. Recently it has lost its charge and it is no longer properly charging so as soon as it comes off the charger it is pretty much dead and we have to send it ""home"" to charge. But it doesn't work any longer so it is sitting there looking pretty and collecting dust. It was a great deal when we got it but I think we will spend the money for a good working one on our next purchase.

It cleans well and I really don't have many complaints there.

The only downsides so far are that it will bang into things a bit, nothing damaged or anything, it just makes noises when it bumps into things and I’m not crazy about it bumping some of my furniture, but, probably not a real issue to be concerned about. I do try to keep front lens clean as that does help.  Sometimes it moves before bumping an obstacle, sometimes not. It will get caught and stuck on computer wires and the like which is not a fault of the unit in my opinion. It won't always make it back to the charger before running out of power depending on the configuration of the area it is working in. It did get stuck on a carpet floor under an end table that it slid under and got stuck. For the price I’d say awesome unit and helping keep my house much cleaner.

"1995","Edit: I am changing my review to 4 stars from 3. I found a YouTube video that helped me find what was causing the error. It was a bit of work to take the vacuum apart then clean the part that was causing the error. But it has run without fail for several weeks since since then.Originally my husband bought me the N79.  But after about 2 months, I started getting a 'Main Brush Malfunction' error.  I had always kept the brush and bin clean.  But the main brush would no longer turn.  I called the company and after some tests, they replaced it with this model, the N79S. It was great.  I ran it most every day because I have two cats. Yes, it would get stuck sometimes under furniture but I'd just put it up and then it ran fine the next day.  One thing to note: if the battery runs down completely, you will have to set up the schedule again in the app.  But here it is about 14 months later and I'm getting the 'Main Brush Malfunction' error on this one.  As always, the brush is clean but it will barely turn.  Obviously I am out of the warranty now.  The Deebot will only run for a minute before the dreaded beeps start and it's done.  Maybe this happens if you run it almost every day like I do.  I don't know what else I could have done to prevent it at.  Right now I'm using my 10 year old Roomba until I can decide what to replace the Deebot with.  I'm wary to try another Deebot now that I've had two models with the same issue.","Reviewed in the United States on August 5, 2019"

It's Aug of 2019 now and I'm fed up with this device.The Good:- It picks up dog hair and generally has a lot of suction.- Easy to clean and even fix.- After a year of daily use, the battery is still strong.- Works just fine with Alexa.The Bad:- It constantly gets stuck.  I swear that sometimes it comes off it's base and goes directly to a ""sticking point"" immediately almost as though it has a will of it's own and wants to make me mad.  By sticking-point, I mean under the corners of a couch or easy chair.  We have Living room couches that are just a little too low in the back for the bot, it will get stuck under these every time.  So we have to keep the bot out of the living room altogether.  To accomplish this, I've had to put 2X4 wood across two door ways to turn away the bot.  So every night or early morning, we have to move these into place... tired of that.- This sticking problem makes it so that it almost never completes its cycle.  I mean maybe once out of 30 times.  In fact when it does, my wife and I are surprised.- It's kind of loud- Just lately, it seems to have gotten aggressive.  Now it pushes the wood out of the way and goes and gets stuck in the living room.- We purchased new rugs and they have large geometric patterns of color.  The bot now gets stuck on the black swipes!  Must be some kind of light sensor, but now it gets stuck in the middle of the rug.Bottom line - I feel we have changed our life and habits too much to accommodate something that is supposed to make life easier and is also supposed to operate on it's own.  The failure rate is just too high. I don't like the disappointment of technology getting me frustrated first thing in the morning... every morning.  We are going to try another manufacturer's product that has ""boundaries"" and ""invisible walls"" accomplished with magnetic strip and hope for the best.","Reviewed in the United States on August 4, 2019"

"2001","Good product","Reviewed in the United States on August 4, 2019"
"2002","We were fairly early adopters of these vacuums, but the performance was disappointing, too little suction and tool little cleaning ability.  We have not had one for years until we bought this.... This much less expensive bot is really a delight.  I am almost always surprised at the amount it picks up.  It slides easily under most furniture, and relentlessly searches out more dirt.  Very pleased at price/performance.","Reviewed in the United States on August 4, 2019"

"2004","Does not pick up anything !  Especially on hardwood floors","Reviewed in the United States on August 4, 2019"
"2005","This does wonders for our tiled floor.  An hour a night keeps our entire house hair- free.  We have 2 dogs and now can walk barefoot without stepping on debris . Also picks up dog food that our one dog flings across the floor.  Life saver and weirdly satisfying to see all the gunk it has picked up.","Reviewed in the United States on August 4, 2019"
"2006","I like it for picking up crumbs, but it doesn’t go in the corners. It also does not pick up my German Shepard’s hair, which was the entire reason I got it.Not even 3 months later and it keeps jamming and beeping. Biggest waste of money.","Reviewed in the United States on August 4, 2019"

"2008","I did a lot of searching, glad I came across DEEBOT N79S. I had it for about 4 months now and I run it 2-3 times a week, my floors look and stay clean of dust dirt and dog hair.  Never any issues. Once in a while DEEBOT may get stuck if a rug lifts up on the edge, but that I believe is more of the rugs fault than DEEBOT. I have mostly vinyl floors, some ceramic tile and several area rugs. DEEBOT does it all, run time is more like 2 hours or so. Another thing I like is the 2 spinning brushes rather than only 1, so both sides are taken care of as DEEBOT travels along. Definitely Recommended!","Reviewed in the United States on August 3, 2019"
"2009"," This thing is great. To start off with, we have a family of 7, plus two dogs and a cat.  Most of our floors are hard. I wanted something that can pick up the fur and keep the floors clean. This does the job. It's quiet and runs for a couple of hours. The reason for four stars instead of five is a couple of reasons: Every once in a while, it loses its mind. It'll get stuck in a corner and have trouble finding its way out—even though there's a clear way out (see the video).  It'll burn its whole battery and not clean. We'll let it charge and then run it again and everything seems to work fine, then. Also, I wish it had a bigger rubber bumper on the front sensor (maybe even one above the sensor and not just below). As the Deebot edges, the sensor gets scratched. After a few months, the Deebot runs into everything instead of sensing the object. I ended up putting Gorilla Tape over the sensor. Once that gets scratched, I just replace the tape.","Reviewed in the United States on August 3, 2019"
"2010","Ok.  So, I've have the DBot for 2 months and had time to oberve enough for an accurate and fair review.  First and foremost,  I would like to say this is a very solid product that does a surprisingly good job I'm picking up debris off of tile and carpet.  Assembly and programming is very simple and easy, and replacement parts such as brush heads and filters are cheap and easily accessible on Amazon. This product can be programmed to vacuum only when you ask it to were set up on a schedule like I have where it vacuums every other day while I am getting ready for work.Pros:  this little guy fits directly under my couch no problem cleaning the tile floor two respectable level at a glance. The reservoir for debris within the device is easy to remove and dump as well as filter maintenance being easily accessible. Does a surprisingly good job transitioning from tile do carpet and vice versa.  Also compatible with Alexa oh, so if you do not have a schedule set up you can simply say "" Alexa, start the vacuum."" And the way it goes. Watch for sales.  I got mine it's a deal of the day and saved over $100 off MSRP, and I feel that it's well worth it.Cons: although it works with Alexa this is not a smart device. Meaning that there is no mapping feature on this particular device and it wanders around the house aimlessly in random patterns taking it substantially longer to clean then I feel it really should. Also if there is anything left or dropped in the floor such as the towel I clean my dog's Paws with when we come in from a walk the deebot will get stuck and you'll come home to it beeping worked with a dead battery.  If you decide to stop the cycle early because it is randomly wandering around the house, again it is not a smart device and does not do very well finding its docking station. So you may have to deal with picking the thing up and putting it on the docking station or just letting it wander around at a lower power bumping into the walls and chairs until it finally figures out where home is, also providing the opportunity to get stuck.  And this is the reason for me starting to cycle while I'm still home oh, so I don't come home to a dirty floor and a a dead battery in my Robot vacuum because it's stuck on top of something.  Don't get me wrong the getting stuck thing is fairly rare and once you figure out what items will cause this issue it's fairly easy to make sure they're not around before it starts. this may be inconvenient timing but the app is already transitioned once in the last 2 months making the app I'm currently using incompatible with the device so I have to go through set up all over again.","Reviewed in the United States on August 3, 2019"
"2011","This is my first and only robot vacuum so I have nothing to compare to, but this thing is amazing on my concrete floors. She sucks up all the dog hair every night. It’s like magic.

"2014","I bought a N79S model in May 2018 and gave it to my sister for Christmas. She loved it. However, now that the warranty has expired, it does not operate properly- after just 8 months of use!  When I called customer service, I was told there was nothing they could do now.  They’re planning to have a repair service set up “this quarter” and I could keep checking back on the website to see when.  So my advice to anyone thinking about buying one of these units is to think twice.  There’s no service after the sale.","Reviewed in the United States on August 2, 2019"
"2015","Buyer beware: This vacuum's app requires access to make and receive phone calls and edit your local files. You can use it with the included remote, but that eliminates all of the advanced features like scheduling.","Reviewed in the United States on August 2, 2019"

"2019","The price for this amazing gem was unbeatable. This is my first robovac so I can't compare with others, but I am extremely happy with it.I gave it 4 stars because in order to get the room edges clean the bot has to be switched to Edge Cleaning, otherwise when it senses the wall is in front, it veers off to another direction.It cleans my hardwood floors, tile floors and area rugs. The room needs a bit of prep before starting by making sure there aren't any wires on the floor or small toys etc.Very easy to clean.I named my bot Jeeves. Absolutely love this bot.","Reviewed in the United States on August 2, 2019"

"2028","Only time will tell how long this things lasts, but in the short amount of time I've owned and used it, it's works like a charm. Pros: cleans well, easy to clean, easy to use. Cons: A little noisy, struggles to find its way back to the base when you hit the home button. Best to use it when you are home because sometimes it gets stuck on uneven surfaces and it will continue revving the motor unless you dislodge it.","Reviewed in the United States on August 1, 2019"
"2029","I don't write too many reviews so bare with me.  I bought this because of my dog (Female GSD) is a shedder. I have had this for a few weeks now.I have tile, wood and area rugs on my first floor (Around 3000 sq ft) and this cleans all surfaces.You have to empty it after each cleaning.It wonders around the house in a hap hazard way. It may not clean every inch every day, but I am sure over the course of the week everything is cleaned.The only negative and reason it doesn't get 5 stars would be about 1 out of 5 cleanings it fails to find its way back to the charging location.  Its a new game....Find the Bot!","Reviewed in the United States on August 1, 2019"
"2030","While the vac worked OK, changing the brushes was an adventure..  New replacement brushes and rollers fit OK, but hear this: if you lose the small metal clip that holds the brush on, you are toast.  No replacements as far as I could find.  Without the clip, the brush wont stay on!","Reviewed in the United States on August 1, 2019"

"2033","I have been using an Oreck for years to clean the house, but this little robot picked up stuff that I didn't even know existed. It is easy to use, on low suction the battery will last long enough to clean about 1200sqft in my place. That is not bad considering how well it cleans. On max suction it is great to get a few rooms cleaned before needing to recharge. I highly recommend this product!","Reviewed in the United States on August 1, 2019"

From kitty hair, house dust, wify hair, kitty food, anything that is small. I run it every morning and it keeps my house really clean. It works very well on hardwood floors. Carpet is just ok. After a year of use the battery life is still pretty good. It has been very reliable. Maybe because i clean the collection container each time before i run it. Some of my friends and relatives are using it too and they love it. There are other brands out there that cost double or triple the price and they maybe better. I don't know. This was my first Robotic Vac and if it crapped out tomorrow i would not hesitate to purchase another DEEBOT vac.","Reviewed in the United States on July 30, 2019"

I secretly just wanted a reason to tell my husband I have to get a Roomba instead... not this ‘other’ brand.So while I waited to leave this review, I used the heck out of it. I even let it get the bugs I’m to chicken to pick up...And let me tell you.. it’s one tough, amazing robotic vacuum cleaner. I set a timer and it runs while we are away from the house daily. It doesn’t fall down the stairs, it gets all of the baseboards, it also smoothly goes over low rugs.","Reviewed in the United States on July 30, 2019"
"2048","I got this to help clean my tile floors. I’ve got two cats (one long hair, one short), a dog (short coat that gets stuck in anything with a weave), and a house under perpetual construction. This little guy just keeps going and going. I don’t have it on WiFi (can’t get any where I’m at) so I can’t give any input on that, but it’s working really well without it. I do wish it had a light or a sensor or a noise or something for when the bin was full, but other than that I love it! I’ll be getting a second one for my kitchen once a it’s done (different level otherwise one would be fine).","Reviewed in the United States on July 30, 2019"
"2049","We had an original roomba and I was pretty hesitant about buying another robot because our OG one was loud and didn’t do that great with 3 dogs, 2 huskies and a shepherd. But I thought hell it’s a good deal why not. It’s a fraction of the price than a new roomba and it doesn’t work well I put my Echo on it and make it a mobile music station. Well it’s been a while now so I figured I would review about it. Hands down the best. I couldn’t be happier. We have all hard wood on our main floor and it does great, not perfect but damn near god status. Less traditional vacuuming and it’s not too loud. The integration with Alexa is awesome for the lazy minded people that don’t want to walk the 3 feet for the remote (that’s me). The sensor is pretty good about not hitting things, but still does. It is also possessed with the soul of an ex I think since it keeps chasing my wife and running into her or its because she kicked it a few times. Either way best bang for the buck.","Reviewed in the United States on July 30, 2019"
"2050","I have been looking at the different Robo Vacs for awhile. This was a budget model that I was paying attention to.Treasure Truck deal came along and figured it was time to jump in at a decent price. For the price the amount of features are pretty good.  Ability to connect via wifi and control through an app. Set schedules and perform different cleaning modes are a nice added bonus. I have hardwood floors but also a pretty thick rug. It does a great job navigating both. Criss crosses across the main rooms and eventually hits pretty much everything. Charge lasts a long time and I usually send it back home long before it runs out of juice.Having this I know what I would look for if I was going to upgrade and spend more for added features - I Wish the smart sensor was a bit smarter, able to map out a room to some degree and more efficiently clean the room. This model is random and does a good job avoiding things but still at times knocks in to chair legs relatively hard. Would also like to be able to set up room boarders so that you can specify if you want it to stay in a specific room. Houses with open concepts will find the thing wandering all over that level of the house. Not overly loud but you hear it going.Not a necessity but with 3 young kids it really helps to run it later at night and cleanup behind them, especially after dinner. A dog also performs this task relatively well.","Reviewed in the United States on July 30, 2019"
"2051","Bought this off the treasure truck a couple weeks back and didn't expect to be impressed, but boy, was I! It was easy to set up and runs quietly and picks up well. It's easy to empty. I do wish it had virtual walls because I have an open floor plan and don't always want to do the entire downstairs.  You can program cleaning times and it goes forever on a charge though, so not a big deal. Overall, I'd say it's a great value for the money! I also own a roomba Discovery (dinosaur). This picked up just a well or better and is way quieter but I'm sure the roombas have improved a lot since I got mine.  Pet owners: I have two dogs that shed and it's done a great job of getting the hair.","Reviewed in the United States on July 30, 2019"

Who knew I would love this almost as much as my kiddos?We have two long-haired big pups (golden retriever and English setter mix), two teens, and a always-on-the-field coaching husband. Deebot runs 2X a day for ~120 minutes at a time. She’s not perfect - but she does a better job than the people when she vacuums 4 hours per day. I never come close to that when I use my manual vacuum. We have an open dining, kitchen, breakfast nook, & LR floorplan.I purchased on sale and believe the item drops $30 off quite regularly, but I would pay full price. I’ve replaced the side brushes and filter once with a generic kit from Amazon & it is working great. The app and Deebot remote work great. I have mine set up on a schedule to come on automatically with the app. I rarely use Alexa to connect (tho it works).The negatives: I have to empty the canister a lot. We are a messy home with the animals/people. I would say once an hour I empty. It’s satisfying  to see all the dirt collected.It often schedules itself to come on at midnight. Despite all I do to correct this, it keeps happening.

"2072","Update: I successfully installed some simple ramps (available on Amazon), then discovered I needed to add some sand paper like, self-stick grippers (also available on Amazon) and double sided carpet tape (yes, also from Amazon) to make it all work and my self-engineered system functions perfectly, only adding about $36 to the overall cost. Now the robot can easily maneuver around my small apartment, crawling up the ramps to go in an out of the rooms. My complaint is if I accidentally set a timer for automatic cleaning, which I did three times on the remote because I wanted to set the time, but instead started the automatic scheduler. NOTHING I did with the help of customer support, would erase those scheduled sessions. Taking the battery out of both the remote and the unit itself and leaving them unconnected for a day made any difference. So I had to turn it off when on the charger, then manually turn back on when I want it to clean. I find this annoying. Even turned off, this thing makes a noise at the mistakenly scheduled time. OMG, what? So I've had to send it back twice now with the same error. So now I'm waiting for the 3rd new unit to arrive. Customer service is great, but two replacements in less than 4 months is also annoying. Obviously, the company stands behind it's product by allowing the returns at their cost, but I can't clean during the down time. It cleans very well on my uneven floor surfaces, running from LR rug, to hardwood floor, to kitchen, bathroom and hallway tile, then into the BR where it encounters rugs, yoga mats and hardwood floors. Ok, this all works thanks to my rigged up system of sticky ramps , but the timer issue puts a chink in the armor. And, BTW, the yoga mats don't like the main vacuum brush, so I move them now. Deebot likes to take little bites out of the padded mats, especially a very thick one I have. If DEEBOT can fix this software error, it will be a dynamic little cleaning device. Am I the only one who has this problem?(See update above) I will update my post after I receive some items I ordered to help it move around my entire apartment. I have 3/4 to 1"" saddles at my doorways and the robot is not always able to climb them. He gets stuck coming out of my bedroom, but it's not his fault. In the meantime, this item works way better than I expected. The dust bin gets full and I have noticed that my floors and the areas under my bed, couches and other furniture are clean for the first time (because I don't like sweeping or vacuuming much). I had a small scheduling issue with the robot, but believe that is now resolved. I bought this item from the Prime Truck. As a bonus, they gave me a gift box full of 25 baby succulents. How did they know I have a huge, indoor succulent garden? I mixed in their plants with mine and now I have an enviable set of plants like I've always wanted. The price point for the robot was very low, so I am extremely happy with this purchase.","Reviewed in the United States on July 28, 2019"

I plugged it in that morning and by that afternoon it was ready to go! I have ceramic tile floors and this cleaned up everything. It has a great sense of direction and it had no problems picking up small items and hair also. It did however try to eat 1 of my shag carpets but that was expected since my carpet did have longer thread and it's probly not a good idea to use around that type of carpets. But I noticed that it did thoroughly clean the entire kitchen, dining Room and family Room area and when it was ready to go back and recharge it went straight back to its charging station on its own and was ready for me to use the next day.

"2094","The N79S is one of those products that almost hits the nail on the head, but it makes you question if you should've gotten something better. I've had the DEEBOT N79S for almost 10 months, so this is a long term review. Here are the pros and cons.Pros:- Solid construction- Has decent suction and will eventually pick up most debris- Has somewhere around a 70% success rate at cleaning my apartment without getting stuck on something that it could have avoided (not counting cables or any other item that you wouldn't run over with a normal vacuum)- Has an even higher success rate at finding the charging dock- The physical remote control that comes with it is extremely handyCons:- The software (both for the robot and the app). More details in the later items on this list.- The N79S uses the infrared sensors on the front to preemptively back away from obstacles. There may be some situations where this comes in handy, but there's far more situations where the robot got stuck in a cycle of *back up -> turn right -> back up -> turn left -> repeat*. It'll eventually break out of this cycle in most cases, but i've had to manually move it sometimes .- Sometimes, it'll slightly prop itself up on a low obstacle and will try to drive forward. Forever. Those infrared sensors somehow couldn't help it here.- It struggles with small crumbs on hard surfaces. The two sweepers slap a lot of the crumbs away from the robot, so it needs to do a few passes to clean hard surfaces.- I've had issues connecting with their iPhone app, but I honestly didn't try too hard to figure out what was going on after it failed to connect twice. No issues with the Android app. I use the physical remote most of the time.Honestly, I can't complain too much about the N79S. It's cheap, and it gets the job done without too much supervision. However, there's some frustrating scenarios that constantly crop up. This will be good for you if you're not actively trying to push the robot to its limits, and if you can accept the fact that this isn't the perfect solution if you're looking for something to clean up while you're at work. You're going to have to give this guy a little shove every now and then, especially if you have any cables laying on the floor.For reference so that you can adjust based on your own layout - I'm in an open floorplan 1100 sqft apartment. 2 rooms are short pile carpet, bathrooms are tile, and kitchen + living room are hardwood.","Reviewed in the United States on July 25, 2019"

She is totally worth it. Very random cleaning. Maybe doesn’t make it around the entire house every day, but with her running every day she at least makes it everywhere once a week or so!! She makes it onto all of my rugs without a problem (black borders and thick oriental rugs). She works best on our hardwood floors.

Also, it doesn’t start working automatically anymore even though the alarm is set on the remote.  Finally, it won’t connect to the app on my phone.  I always shows as offline no matter what I do to connect it to the WiFi.  Expensive product for only seven months of good service.","Reviewed in the United States on July 21, 2019"

"2140"," 2nd Update: Only five months in and the thing no longer works. The roller brush no longer spins. I took it out and put it back in and it still didn’t work. Without the spinning brush the vacuum doesn’t pick stuff up anymore. And the oddest part is that the thing randomly turns itself on. This morning I found it dead in the bathroom.1st Update: when this thing is working, it works.  We noticed that only after a short time of using it that suction started to suffer. It did so great in the beginning I had a hard time believing the vacuum started to fail already so I decided to replace the brushes because ours were looking warped.  We have 4 animals and I have long hair and all of the brushes were wrapped up in all that hair. Replacing the brushes did the trick. It’s back to being awesome!Original review:  Sunday My husband and I swept, vacuumed and mopped. Tuesday, we ran this brand new robot vacuum we got on prime day. The pic shows all the crap it picked up, after one session of cleaning. It moves easily between our area rugs, tile and hardwood floors. We have three cats and one dog and lots of hair. This picks it all up and in one vacuuming session it’s full. We have four litter boxes and the thing I love about this the most is that it keeps the area around the litter boxes free of litter. It’s been a great addition, especially since we’re not great housekeepers.Needless to say, this little robot is awesome. I highly recommend you get one!","Reviewed in the United States on July 21, 2019"
"2141","This little floor cleaner works well on our hardwood floors. The random cleaning mode makes for a lot of wasted battery time, and it will get caught under things that are about the same height off the floor as this cleaner is high. But most of our pet hair ends up near the walls, so the edge cleaning mode works great. Doesn't do well with throw rugs. Battery life isn't great, but adequate for 1-2 rooms. Not too loud. If you just need an inexpensive basic floor cleaner, this is not a bad choice.","Reviewed in the United States on July 21, 2019"
"2142","For what sections of floor it goes over it does an okay job but it misses the sections it doesn’t go over since it operates in a zigzag pattern and not a straight line up and back.","Reviewed in the United States on July 21, 2019"
"2143","My mom got this unit for her birthday, otherwise it would be returned same day. If the vacuum goes over the spot that needs to be cleaned it does the job, but you’ll wait till the battery dies out. This vacuum doesn’t have  tracking device so I doesn’t know if it was in this spot or not and it will run in the same place over and over again, leaving half the room dirty, and when it’s time to go back, it will need 30 min to get back. Vacuum is avoiding 60% of objects so it’s not bad and won’t fall from stairs. It’s good for one room not a whole 1 level house. I wouldn’t buy one.","Reviewed in the United States on July 21, 2019"

This robot does a great job of picking up pet hair and all sorts of other dirt and cat litter. I also have a very thick area rug and medium to high pile carpet in the bedrooms and it didn’t have a problem with it at all. It did get stuck on my bathroom rug since that rug has long tendrils on the edges. When I called it back to the charger it certainly took its time making its way back as if it was drunk but it eventually got there.

"2158","UPDATE: We had to get THREE of these within the warranty period, and now the third (received less than a year ago) is giving the same code (three beeps) over and over... and over, despite taking it apart cleaning, and verifying all is well... repeatedly. It won't clean for more than 10 minutes at a time. I suppose you get what you pay for, but I had hoped for a better quality, lasting product. It was good while it lasted, Deebot, but you're just not made to last.Our first Deebot had to be replaced when it wouldn't charge after 2 months or so. We received a replacement. It's worked really well with lots of hair from our lab mix dog (although not as well on area rugs) until the past week. We have used it on average 2-3x per week. Now the main rotor brush doesn't turn, hair collects under the unit and doesn't go into the collection bin. Hair is deposited in large clumps. And the unit stops to beep every 30-60 seconds. This second unit is about 9 months old. I'm in touch with the company, and will attempt to update this review pending their response.","Reviewed in the United States on July 19, 2019"

"2160","Bought June 2018 after years of being a fateful Roomba owner, and I was unfortunately wooed by the lower price. Buyer beware! After about 6 months, he had a hard time getting to his dock—he would die en route. After 7 months, battery only stayed charged about ten minutes. By 11 months, battery would not charge and now deebot is worthless. Customer service sucks, and I don’t know how to get another battery or how to install it. I wish I had spent the additional $200 and bought another roomba—it lasted almost 6 years. Sadly, I recommended Deebot to a friend when it was still working. Hers died within a year as well.

My house is all hardwood flooring with tiles in the kitchen. I have 2 small dogs who shed a ton! Bender does excellent at picking up the dog hair! It has a powerful suction. I usually run it once a day/ every other day. I have not had any issues with it at all. You can purchase replacement brushes for when they need replaced. We have not had to replace any yet. ECOVACS also has an app to use with this. The app tells you the battery life, brush life and you can use the virtual remote to control where the deebot goes. The app could use some improvement, but it works. I like to use the remote function to chase my niece around the house because she is terrified of Bender.

I have only used it a few days, but it surely does pick up a lot of gunk! It picked up an ink pen with no problem.  It's very user friendly, too.  I like that I can control if from my iphone.  The only issue I have (and this is probably with any vac) is making sure anything stringy or electrical cords are out of the way.  It's gotten hung up on a small bath rug, but quickly untangled itself.  It caught on a fringed throw that I didn't realize was touching the floor.  That one made it completely stop!

This little guy is fabulous- for what it is.It’s not going to work well on your shag carpeting, to pick up after your 8 prize-winning English Sheepdogs, or to keep running for a week without needing to be emptied.It will, however, run  great over hard surface flooring and low-level rugs, keep the dust bunnies from roaming around under furniture and in corners, and pick up hair, dust, crumbs, and debris.I love this little dude, even though he’s a tad high-maintenance, and not the sharpest tool in the shed. He fits right in with my other 4 pets. Lol!  I let him run overnight while we’re asleep. Sometimes he runs until his battery is low and parks himself on his charger. Sometimes he rolls over a cat toy and panics because the main brush is now clogged with said toy. Sometimes he gets caught in the SAME spot by the fire place where there’s an annoying change in elevation. I stick him back on his charger and we try again tomorrow. :) I empty the reservoir every few days and my floors are wonderfully free from crumbs, hair, and dirt.

At this point, I would give the vacuum itself 4.5 stars or so.  Support would get zero stars, cause I have seen zero support outside of reading stuff on their website.About a week ago, I believe our deebot got itself stuck somewhere and instead of giving up in a timely manner, the motor appears to have kept going long enough to heat the plastic housing to the point where it became flexible.  The whole motor/wheel assembly on one side is now crooked, and it just drives in circles.I contacted support via my smartphone, and sent pictures and a description of my problem.  That was about four days ago and nothing.  Today via PC I found a support phone number.  I called and only got voicemail.  So I left a message and have not heard back yet.  Personally, I feel that they shouldn't be expected to call my back on the same day, but this is my second attempt to contact support after four days.  Also, reading the web, I am by far NOT the only person who is experiencing a complete ""vacuum"" in the technical support area.  (pardon my pun)  I will update this review and give them their extra stars back if they ever bother to contact me and resolve my issue.Update:  It took a while for support to get back to me, but they did and they replaced my unit.

We even put the charger under one of our couches and it finds it way home every time.It isn't all rainbows and sun shine though. You have to prep the space it is going to be used in or it can stuck or small objects can get sucked up and jammed the bush motor. Turtle has gotten jammed up twice in the past month (which makes it beeps like crazy and stops dead in its tracks). It has also gotten stuck now under the edge of our dish wash, which is about a 1/2 an inch lower than the rest of the cabinets in the kitchen. You also have to empty the bin after each time it goes out, or at least we do because we have 4 kids and 2 dogs that really destroy the floors.The app and Google Assistant integration are good.Overall I love this robot and wish I had purchased one sooner.","Reviewed in the United States on July 16, 2019"

"2210","[edited]After a month of usage, I found Deebot works pretty well in my home on both carpet and wood floor.Pros:The vacuum power is pretty good, I found you can adjust the vacuum power on the app.The main brushes are high quality. One of my experience with previous generation of roomba was the plastic/rubber brush that ends up not being able to pickup small debris and prone to failure when long hairs tangle on them. Deebot's brush does a better job with (seems like) synthetic materials and dense fibers.Integration with Alexa and app is pretty good. The app can show the life cycle of consumable parts.Cost effective: good performance with the price point.Cons:Occasional docking problems. I guess there might be a firmware update but the docking problem has significantly reduced in the past month.It doesn't build a house map so still use what I call a Monte Carlo Cleansing process. Which is great to me since I don't want my floor map to be in another company's cloud. However it might be not as efficient. But provided that similar products might cause 5 times, I think it is a good tradeoff.// originalI mean it cleans pretty well, but it doesn't DOCK! OMG it is so painful to watch it docking...

"2214","I work outside a lot, so I get a bunch of dirt on my tile floors. It’s so great to come home and see the vacuum lines. I let it run while I’m gone, so I’m not sure if it gets stuck on my rugs or if it just runs out of battery. I don’t know that it’s ever made it back to the charging station itself. It never claimed to do well on thick carpets or rugs, so I’m not too mad about that. I had a Roomba before, and it would call out when it was stuck for long periods of time, but this one doesn’t do that. I usually have to go searching for it when I get home. Either way, it definitely beats vacuuming by hand. The couple of times I have been home and watched it, it doesn’t hit the items most of the time to make it turn around. That helps keep the scuffs off of my furniture!","Reviewed in the United States on July 15, 2019"

"2217","I’ve had it for 5 months now and it has been working great for low carpet rugs and hardwood floors. It picks up majority of the mess my short haired dog leaves behind.

"2218","First off, I love this thing. I have hard surface floors on the whole bottom of my house and with having a dog and a cat it picks up the dog and cat hair wonderfully. But let me just say that the suction power works so well that when my newly adopted dog decided to poop on the floor while I was in the shower one morning and the deebot went off at 6:15 am like it normally does, it not only sucked up some of the (wet) poop, but it also decided to leave a nice trail of poo for me to have to clean up when I got out of the shower. (Go ahead and laugh HA!) So after that happening, I decided to contact ECOVACS to try to find out the best way to clean the interior of the machine out. They responded to my email within minutes on a Friday night around 10 pm and they asked for my proof of purchase to see if it still fell under the warranty. Once I did that, they responded back the next day telling me that since it is under warranty they were going to send me a brand new machine! I never in a million years expected that and of course I was thrilled that either myself or my boyfriend would have to clean out a poopy machine. So in my eyes that is top notch service from this company and I would highly recommend this machine!","Reviewed in the United States on July 15, 2019"
"2219","We first purchased this robot vacuum a little over a year ago. It was our first jump into robot vacuums. We purchased it because it was steeply on sale and had generally favorable reviews. Right out of the box, it was easy to use and worked well enough. Sure, being a lower-grade robot vacuum, it didn't have the BEST pathing hardware/software, but it did a good enough job. However, we had problems after less than six months of light usage(maybe every-other-day). There was a substantial clicking sound in one of the rotating brushes. We worked with Ecovacs who took GREAT care of us, but it was ultimately decided that it could not be fixed and they would send us a replacement. However, the second one has had more problems than the first (again, only having owned it for less than six months with semi-daily use). This second vacuum, despite being the same model, has a slightly higher profile than the first and gets stuck on things (e.g. the edge of the couch) far more often than the original. Plus, the front bumpers have now become defective and get easily stuck in the 'bumped' position, meaning that it routinely thinks it is running into things, leading to it rotating for about 20 seconds then shutting down and beeping. This happens so frequently that it's hard to use it as it is more than likely going to shut down within minutes.It's difficult to give this vacuum a good rating. It's definitely what you pay for - a very low-grade robot vacuum. Kudos to Ecovac for great customer service, though. I'd just recommend spending a little more money on a higher grade robot vacuum, even potentially from Ecovacs (although we will still be looking). A bit more money will get you a vacuum with substantially better pathing and hopefully fewer functional issues.","Reviewed in the United States on July 15, 2019"

"2222","So I waited to post a review until after I've actually used the product for a while.  I purchased in Feb.2019, used it every day for about 30 mins a day up until about a month ago, when it stopped working.  Worked very well, only negative thing I saw was that sometimes it had a hard time finding its ""home"".  I could not believe the amount of pet hair and dirt this thing picks up.  Sadly, for some reason, it stopped working a month ago.  At first we thought it was not charging.  Or maybe it had something stuck on the rollers.  After troubleshooting it ourselves, we ended up calling the support number that was listed.  After troubleshooting with them over the phone, they decided to send us a complete replacement which made us happy.  Very good customer service.  We'll see how the new one goes and I'll try to come back and re-post later.","Reviewed in the United States on July 15, 2019"
"2223","I liked that it grabbed everything well, but I didn’t like how often I had to go rescue it from a bathroom rug or under the bed. We have two shedding dogs and as long as it has a clear path to the hair it will grab it and usually not just blow it away. So a little prep of pulling out all the dining room chairs, moving the trash can, etc. is in order for it to get everywhere you need.  Also, with longer human hair it really got tangled up fast and needed emptying and cleaning/yanking for it to do a good job and not screech at you loudly as it works. No more support through Amazon anymore but Ecovacs is very helpful if you call.","Reviewed in the United States on July 15, 2019"

"2226","I really love having one of those at home, and for the price it’s definitely worth it. It cleans, it’s not excessively loud, and deals with obstacles fairly well.Overall, the vacuum could easily get 5 stars if not for the bugs.  Specifically, 2 things bother me:1. It doesn’t really understand the “return to base” command.  I mean, it takes a good 5 minutes for it to actually make it back to the base after you’ve given the command. I’m hoping that will get better with time as the vacuum understands my house layout better - but so far no signs of that...2. Whenever there’s a power outage (which happens often at my place), the robot just starts cleaning for no apparent reason. Last time there was a short outage due to a storm, and I wouldn’t have known except that I was woken up at 4am by the Deebot doing the rounds... <U+0001F605>","Reviewed in the United States on July 15, 2019"

Honestly, I once moved my bed once and saw a mound of sand and hair. Super gross. Like. Clumps. Yikes. Anyways, I bought this little guy and he just obliterates the dirt. Seriously. Our house is pretty filthy so I might have to clean it out twice for it to get everywhere, but given how many dogs we have and how many little crevices there are, I don’t mind at all. Sometimes he likes to run over your phone cords and you have to chase after him and pull it out, but given everything, I’m still super happy with it. He also does a really good job going front the concrete to rugs. Honestly, I’d buy one for every room if I could.","Reviewed in the United States on July 14, 2019"

Kudos for Ecovac customer service, they sent a prepaid shipping label to send back since it was under warranty and promptly sent out a new one.  Cannot recommend the unit due to only getting around 8 months of occasional use before total failure.  If the replacement unit goes bad it will not be covered under warranty and I'll have a $200 piece of garbage.

Then the lens covering the forward sensors gets so scratched that the unit can no longer ""see"" where it's going. So, it rams into everything at full speed. The suction begins to go on it after a few months so that the outtake to the bin is constantly clogged and has to be cleaned out by hand. And it always seems to repeatedly seek out the two places in my house where it gets stuck, multiple times a cleaning session. Sometimes it programs itself to start automatically cleaning in the middle of the night scaring the hell out of me thinking there is an intruder in my house.

It was also entertaining to watch the dog react to it.After about 3 months or so, I noticed it was bumping into everything. The screen was scratched.

It bumps into every wall, dark or light, gets stuck on cords and power strips, pushes shoes into other rooms. I can't leave it unattended or it will get stuck and die in some corner of the house. The Deebot is now a Dumbot. It also has a hard time finding ""home"" when it needs to recharge. It will be in the same room as the charger, right next to it and suddenly, when it's time to charge, it will go off to the next room.

When it get stuck on something, such as our fireplace hearth, it doesn't turn off. It will keep grinding its wheels on the carpet for literally hours; digging a deeper and messy mark into the carpet. It is pretty bad that the design of this didn't account for the obvious error condition that no sensor of any kind had been triggered within the past few minutes. The same problem also occurs with table legs that curve as they meet the floor.Update: This device also suffers from the same design flaw of the early Roomba's. If your attempts to clean it do not allow it to perform smoothly -- it keeps stopping and complaining, you may need to do some minor disassembly of the brush's roller bearing. This is the non-driven end. If it does not rotate very easily, it needs interior cleaning. It has 3 parts: a metal spindle and two plastic parts. All parts are pushed together. The plastic parts have 3 tiny bumps that keep them in place. You will need to separate all three parts, starting with the spindle. Inside you will find hair and similar stacked up inside the plastic nut part of the assembly. Remove dirt, reassemble, good for another few months.Overall, despite the flaws mentioned above, I find this to be a good machine at a reasonable price point.","Reviewed in the United States on July 9, 2019"

What prompted me to select this product were the customer reviews, its price/value, profile or clearance (ability to go under most of my furniture) verses other robotic vacuums and Ecovac's ability to interface with both my iPhone and Amazon Alexa device.  My Deebot had performed flawlessly for 12 months and then, oooh it would start as programmed, but shortly after it signaled (2 beeps) that there was a, ""main brush malfunction"".  I placed a call to support which was quickly answers by a human and after a few troubleshooting steps the support tech asked for some information regarding my purchase, i.e., date of purchase and order number (both available from Amazon).  The next day I was furnished with a no-charge return shipping label and was told to send it back.  Upon receipt by Ecovac, they quickly turned around and sent me a replacement, providing me with all the relevant shipping/tracking information.  I received my replacement 12 days from the date I shipped my malfunctioning unit back to Ecovac. Using their enclosed instructions I was able to again, quickly interface it with my home network, activate it on my iPhone and link it to my Amazon Echo.  I can't say enough about Ecovac's customer service and support.  They have been nothing short of excellent!  It was a great choice for me and I believe it would also be a great choice for others.","Reviewed in the United States on July 9, 2019"

Got caught on a pile of laundry when we forgot to close the door.  Its quite, really!  We have a big house and it does a good job of cleaning hardwood floors and small carpeted areas.

"2305","I purchased Sep 2018.  I'm at almost a year in but it's acting flaky.To start, I think like others have stated, it's a sweeper, not really a vacuum.  Yeah it gets stuff off the carpet too, it just isn't that efficient.  The spinning brushes on the front whisk stuff away just as much as they do bring debris in to be vacuumed up.  It's also super dumb.  It's unusual that it will be back in the charging cradle by the end of the run on it's own without me having to get up and get it unstuck or some other error.This one time it was under a 4 leg chair.  It was like 75% out, when it hit the bumper and it turned 180 and went right back under the chair.  There's also a corner in the house it always gets stuck, just because it's too dumb to find it's way out.  And it will completely get stuck on things like a cat scratcher base that isn't high enough for the bumper to hit.ANYWAY, as of now, almost a year, something is completely wrong with it.  The sensor doesn't work anymore so it just runs around and smashes into walls, chairs, etc.  It was also trying to start at midnight, despite not having a schedule then.  Support gave me a reset option, but that only half helped.The best I can say is that it helps keep things on the floor from sticking to my feet, but that's about it.  I just wish it was smarter.","Reviewed in the United States on July 9, 2019"

I originally wanted something that would work well on my hardwood floors. If you actually do ""living"" on a hardwood floor, there are a lot of bitties which show up over the course of a couple of days. Even if you are clean, the hardwood always shows the particles. Dee vacuums the hardwood like a champion. We have low carpets so she works will on those too, and the transitions from one to another are smooth. I move Dee from my first floor to my second floor on a regular basis. I have even used her in my motor home. This vacuum does an outstanding job for the money. After each run, I always empty her and then she is ready for her next trip. I talk about Dee so much, my neighbor bought TWO!!  For my purposes, this vacuum sucks and does it in a beautiful fashion.

"2340","I have had my replacement for a a few months now and have found it to be a great robovac. In Arizona the dust is extremely fine like face powder, and the robovac is really great picking up the dust and hair from two cats. It's unbelievable how much cat accommodates in a couple of days!  Be sure to use Auto mode to avoid the wall bumping and damage to the lens. It's a well made product and would not hesitate to by another DEEBOT vacumm. Overall a good robovac for the money. It's design flaw is it's IR sensors that help it from bumping walls. I am like one of many others that have had this issue. For some reason the sensors fail to detect walls regardless of the wall's color/light within a couple weeks to a month of use.  Customer support was very good once I got acceptance of the problem. However, I don't know if the replacement will last any longer. If yours starts bumping into walls after being used it for a relatively short time, turn in a warranty claim.Got my replacement and realized that the device doesn't use the IR sensors when used in Single Room mode. It just bumps around the room, of course, scratching up the plastic IR lens and therefore will interfere with the IR system used in Auto mode. Verified with customer support that this operation is by design. So word to the wise, try to always use Auto mode and save your DEEBOT from self-destruction!","Reviewed in the United States on July 6, 2019"

Most of these vacuum Bots will get stuck under low hanging furniture, floor undulations, or floor registers so after having to deal with that a couple times I pretty much put it away for 8 months. I've got two dogs that shed andextraordinary amount so I organized my room by making a few little cardboard barriers to avoid low Furniture and make it roll over the floor register without getting stuck. That takes about 5 minutes prep then I turn on the machine and it goes to work for about 2 hours I do empty it four or five times. Each time there's an enormous amount of dust and dog hair to dump. I'm very impressed with this, especially after reading the reviews on Vacuums in general.My mother has a newer Roomba she likes it a lot and this one does everything hers does for about 60% of the price.I've got tile floor, medium pile carpet and some laminated floor also.The Deebot moves pretty effortlessly from one type of floor to the other. the carpet is raised about a half inch above the floor and it maneuvers back and forth over that smoothly 98% of the time.Considering I would spend 40 to 45 minutes of vacuuming the same area with a Dyson this does a great job. I will start using it regularly and glad I bought it. I haven't even begun to play with the remote or programming yet so it could turn out to be even better then I'm thinking it is right now.Battery life is as advertised it finds its way back to its little charging station pretty amazing.","Reviewed in the United States on July 6, 2019"

It does not clean super well for our area rug because the rug has dips in the pattern (so some of the carpet is higher than other parts) but it really helps our floors not be disgusting. If you get a robot vacuum just know that you will most likely be pulling out your normal vacuum every once in awhile for a better deep clean. If you have the ability to block off a room and put it on single room mode it does surprisingly well around edges! You can't beat the price!","Reviewed in the United States on July 2, 2019"

Worked great for about 5 months, then made weird clicking sounds as it ran and continually “malfunctioned.” Replaced all brushes and filters- still not fixed. Called the company and after about 3 weeks of back and forth received a refurbished one (which they failed to mention— they said it was new). This one also worked great for about 4 months- then this morning I heard the familiar click. So, all in all this works great for a bit but begins to fail a few months in.

"2396","I’ve had this Deebot for 10 months now and I can say it’s a 3/4 star product.First off, my deebot will not program. Even when I called ecovacs and the guy went step by step with me several times to program it, it wouldn’t program. At first I was annoyed by this but now I don’t care.The side bristles have lasted 10 months of vacuuming 4-5 times a week. The main brush is still perfectly fine so I’d say the quality is pretty good for those. I have mainly hardwood and very low-pile area rugs that it runs on. I have no pets. It will get stuck on my carpet and my thicker rug so I have to close the door to the carpeted closet and I have to flip up the rug ends so the deebot won’t climb up. It’s a little cumbersome but the deebot is $139.... it’s no $500 iRobot.  So I expect as much.It cleans randomly.... there’s no way it remembers where it’s cleaned or anything like that. Our robot is an idiot and sometimes I have to guide it to a new area of the house because I’ve noticed its done the same movements in the same area for like 20 minutes.It seems to throw around little crumbs or dead grass pieces or just really light junk. It can’t quite suck those up all the time so it’s annoying that I have to stand there with the controller to make sure it gets the crumbs or basically I vacuum or sweep the crumbs before I run the deebot which seems to kind of defeat the purpose of the deebot. I don’t know.All in all I like our robot because it does light weekly maintenance and it’s nice that my floors never get too dusty or nasty but I also thoroughly clean at least once a month even with the robot. I do wish it was a little better though but I guess if I wanted a smarter and better vacuum I just have to pay more money for better features. All in all our vacuum is kind of an idiot, mostly does it’s job and sometimes needs its hand held, but it’s still loved. I’d trade it in in a heartbeat if someone handed me an iRobot for free.","Reviewed in the United States on July 1, 2019"

It still got stuck at places that I thought I'd have no trouble getting out of, such as slating table leg, but overall it was a trusty  machine that made me consider upgrading to higher end Deebot models.But after about a year it stopped working. It has low battery warning with red light and 4 beeping sound when the battery is fully charged, which makes me suspect that the rechargeable battery has died. Roomba which n79 replaced still works with the original battery after 7 years albeit shorter time, so one year of battery usage is quite disconcerting.

"2461","We bought one of these about 3 months ago and loved it so much that we bought another for our best friend’s house where we stay a lot. We all think it’s a life changer. That may seem like hyperbole but I assure you that when you realize that you will never have to vacuum again, you will be amazed. No, it cannot do stairs but it does such a great job on tile, wood-type floors and carpet that your old vacuum will end up with as much dust on it as in it. At first we thought that it couldn’t possibly be as good on carpet as our Dyson, and if you actually vacuum by hand every day then that could be true. But if you’re like us, using the robot every day far exceeds the frequency of doing it manually. Our carpets have never looked or felt better. We no longer have kids or pets and we don’t wear shoes in the house so your needs may be different, but I cannot imagine what features this machine lacks that I would ever need. It marches around the house, sometimes purposefully and sometimes randomly, but really gets the job done. If it misses something or you want to send it to a problem area there’s the remote control to do that. The remote also has several programs including automatically going out at a preset time of day. It can also be controlled by a phone app. The litter box is plenty big and easy to clean. The batteries seem to last at least an hour and a half with mixed floor types although we really just send it out and do something else. It can get snagged on extension cords, drapes, loose area rugs etc. It’s pretty easy to eliminate these problem areas and if it gets stuck it will beep to let you know and if you’re not home it will just shut off and wait for you. If you put its home base in an area that’s not too tricky it will almost always make it home by itself. Ours sleeps under a dresser. This machine needs about 3.5” of clearance to get underneath something which means that it will clean under many beds, dressers and sofas. We will NEVER be without one of these type of machines for the rest of our lives and I would buy this unit yet again.","Reviewed in the United States on June 26, 2019"

Clearance is a big deal, it will jam itself under a table or cabinet with low clearance and this is common as I have found out from others I know with robo vacuums. There are solutions for this and I cut 2x2 wooden posts and put them under the kitchen cabinets to keep the robot back and put 10 lb. lifting plates in places that are hard to see and keep the vacuum from getting under things.  These were much cheaper options than buying the ""smart"" fences to keep these robot vacuums away from things.I called customer service after we had the unit a month or so because I would come home and find it stopped somewhere.  I thought it was the battery.  Customer service had me start the vacuum, they listened to the number of beeps and told what was wrong.  There was something interfering with the better bar.  Customer service instructed me how to check it and it had picked up a twist tie and it got lodged in the beater bar.  Once I removed it the vacuum worked like a charm again.  Great customer service.  I have also ordered original replacement parts for the vacuum that are much better than the generic ones sold on-line.","Reviewed in the United States on June 26, 2019"
"2468","In our household, we call this little robotic disc vacuum, ""The Gobbler""! It does an outstanding job on our tile and hardwood floors. It's easy to program, ""smart"", lightweight but durable, easy to empty, and relatively quiet. It may need an occasional assist over a threshold, but at its ""knockoff"" price, it's an excellent value for the money.","Reviewed in the United States on June 26, 2019"
"2469","We bought the deebot about a year ago and were surprised how well the little guy worked. We have a small apartment (670 sq ft), so many of the issues claimed by others wasn't a big deal for us. We used it, on average, once a week. While it did pick up surprisingly well, we had to constantly save it from traps it found via cords and corners and sometimes just simple transitions from carpet to hardwood (which is what we mostly have). While far from a smart tool, we were happy with it. Till it just stopped. Completely. We checked the charging base, we checked the vacuum itself, everything we could think of. There were no discernible problems, it simply wouldn't accept a charge or do anything but beep any longer.  Again, this is after only about a year of fairly light usage. For the price and what it claims to do, it's just not worth it. We were sold on the idea. The technology and quality of this product didn't match up. I'd pass.***EDIT***After customer service responded to us from ECOVACS and finagling around with a few other things, we got Gizmo (the vacuum) working again. Thanks for the helpful tech support from this company.","Reviewed in the United States on June 26, 2019"

"2474","We ordered the DEEBOT N79S about 2 months ago and couldn't be happier with it. Even though it doesn't map out your room it will still cover about 90 - 95% of the area in a single run by randomly bouncing around. We have an extended area that covers out Dining Room and Living Room that is about 250 - 300 square feet that it cleans in one run. We have a large long haired Collie/Golden Retrieve mix that sheds like crazy and it has no problems getting all of the hair up. We clean out the tray and the brush after every use but that only takes a minute at the most. The brush wheel is easily removed to be cleaned if you want to remove every hair off of it. We also use this on our tile floors and it has no problems getting up most of the dirt. I honestly don't think that we have gotten out our vacuum for our rugs since we have purchased this item.  We have moved the DEEBOT to every room in the house and it works perfectly no matter if it is a heavy rug, thin rug or tile floor.  The only draw back we have seen is that it does get stuck under our china cabinet even though it is very close to the floor. So we have put a could of cardboard boxes underneath the cabinet to keep it from getting stuck. We were able to catch the DEEBOT on special for $150 and it was money well spent. I would highly recommend this item to anyone that is looking for an affordable robot to lean your carpets and floors for you.","Reviewed in the United States on June 26, 2019"

Keeps kids entertained, our toddler cheers it on and they all take turns naming it and helping tidy up when it’s running. One or two dogs is a husky with lots of shedding undercoat fur, and this thing makes fur management a snap. We run it 3-4 times per week, and it gets loads of dirt, dust and pet hair each time. It runs over an hour on our hardwood and tile, puts itself to home base when it gets low battery or too full. It does fine on rugs heavy enough to hold themselves in place, but does push smaller lighter weight rugs around. It does okay on thicker carpet just seems to use battery faster than other floor types. The suction is strong enough for all duty we have used it for, and it will tangle like any vacuum on tasseled rugs or thinner fabric items laying around. I haven’t replaced the filter or brushes yet but it looks like they might need more frequent change outs with as heavy use as we have. Only drawback is it’s noisy enough to make conversation difficult, but it can be programmed to run any time or when you’re out of the rooms doing other things.

There is no way to calibrate the sensors to prevent it from getting stuck underneath the same 4 things, every single day.The other problem I have, is, when it finally does get stuck, it beeps loudly several times, then fully discharges its battery. Why is this a thing? So if it gets stuck, 10 minutes into a cleaning cycle, it'll fully discharge, forcing me to recharge it for several hours before I can start it again. This is a MASSIVE design flaw. It should have some kind of standby mode, sleep mode something. This is the worst deal breaker you can have for a battery powered robotic anything.No way to put beacons up for ""no go zones"". No way to select specific rooms to focus on. If the door is open, it's going in there. If there's so much as a dryer sheet on the floor, the whole thing jams up and HOPEFULLY you get there before the battery starts to discharge so you can clear the clog.Like I said, you get what you pay for.

There is an app that can be downloaded that can increase suction of the vacuum to provide a deeper clean. Unfortunately I could not get the app do work.

It even swept up a squishy cat toy from under the couch.Not near as loud as a stand up vacuum.Takes up far less space as a regular vacuum when being stored.Comes with a remote to navigate the bot to specific areas or cleaning patterns. Remote can also be set for specific times for the bot to run.Cons: app to sync with phone is useless because it does not sync.When in operation, the rotating brushes creates a bit of a fan which can cause the hair bunnies to blow away from the unit.Even though it makes less than a regular vacuum, it’s still a bit loud.Sometimes it has trouble finding its home once it’s done running its cycle and you have to help guide it home.","Reviewed in the United States on June 22, 2019"

"2541","I pretty much never write reviews but I just HAD to say this thing is AMAZING!  It truly is the best purchase I've ever made.  I got it on sale as a deal of the day - I paid $174 and got a 3gen Echo Dot with it.  Worth every penny!  Are there more expensive models that do a better job?  Sure.  But for a first time robot vacuum purchase, this thing is great.  Does it clean in a random pattern?  Yes. Does it miss a spot once in a while?  Sure.  But if you run it enough it gets virtually every square inch of your floors that isn't a tiny nook in a corner.  It goes under all my couches and along the baseboards in my kitchen.I have very old wood floors in a rental (so I can't have them resealed myself) and sweeping them basically just pushes dirt around.  No more!  The first several times I ran this thing it picked up a terrifying amount of dirt.  The best thing is it picks up all the tiny particles of dirt that sweeping NEVER did.  I love being able to walk around barefoot again without feeling nasty floor dirt on my feet.  I cannot speak to how it works on carpet as I don't have any - but I would imagine this works best for wood/tile floors.Make sure you follow the directions for cleaning DEE BOT so you get the longest life out of it as possible.  Dump the container after every use.  Clean the outer filter 2x/week at least, and the inner filter 1x/week.  Clean the hair out of the brushes on the bottom as needed.  Sometimes it will eat things that make it freak out, just remove them from the brushes.I use my Echo Dots (I have several) to tell it to go clean and tell it to go home and charge, which is awesome.  Sometimes I use the remote to direct it to clean up specific messes - which is WAY easier to do, siting on the couch watching TV, than getting the broom/dust pan out and sweeping.  I use this the most for cat litter, which is picks up excellently.  I have the app but don't use it much, I don't find it necessary with Alexa/the remote.  You can set it on a cleaning schedule, but, I like to put all our chairs up before it runs, and I have to pick up all the cat toys.  If it encounters a cat toy it usually tries to eat it and gets stuck, but it doesn't ruin it or anything, just have to pull it out.  It gets stuck on the curtains sometimes, and it kind of slid over a 5"" threshold into my office and cried for help.  You do have to rescue it sometimes, but it's so, so, so worth it.  Also, it will just shut off if it gets stuck on something and you don't respond to it's cries for help.  Our power went out in the middle of the night once and when it came back on it somehow activated DEE BOT.  I came down to a bunch of stuff pulled off my coffee table and was like.....this is really odd.  I found DEE BOT under my TV console tangled in a bunch of wires.  It didn't hurt anything and I was able to easily untangle it.  I'm going to get some wood cut at Lowes and put it under the TV area so DEE BOT can't reach the cords anymore - right now I'm using a mop to block the area.While this is a cheaper robot vacuum it is much better than a cheap one my friend bought.  Hers races around her house crashing into walls - this one DOES NOT.  It is very gentle and lightly bumps into things sometimes before turning.  We have two light-weight bikes in our living room and it glides around them easily without knocking them over.Bonus: I have HORRIBLE allergies I take antihistamines for daily.  I have a cat and I'm allergic to my cat.  It picks up ALL dust/cat hair with ease and has dramatically improved my allergies.  Why are you still reading this obscenely long review?? BUY IT!","Reviewed in the United States on June 22, 2019"

"2552","We've been using this for a few months now. I am pleased with it. We mainly have floor tiles in our house. Cleans very well. I do have a problem with scheduled clean jobs. It seems to be out of sync with what I set on the app. I do not recommend this product if you have carpets in your house. You also need to consider furniture. I have a couch that the robot some times gets under but is unable to get out of. Once it gets stuck, it starts beeping and you need to rescue it. I try to block of the entrance so it doesn't get under my couch. Does a fair job of finding the base station when its out of charge although it's not always successful finding it. Alexa integration works well. We let the robot clean every day even if the house looks clean - its interesting how the dust container fills up with dust that i cant really see on the floors. I must say the robot is doing a really good job. It is not perfect, but I am pleased so far.","Reviewed in the United States on June 21, 2019"

I cannot say he is quiet, he definitely makes some noise as he rumbles from room to room and bounces off of things in his way. The battery life is excellent. I set him to auto and he goes for about an hour and a half before he takes himself back to the dock. He has full reign of my first floor and he’s only been seriously stuck once. He will complain if he pulls in something too large, like a child’s sock. I just go find him, remove the offending item and he’s on his way again.

Second, the battery dies EVERY TIME leaving it in the middle of my floor-it has NEVER, not one time, made it back to the base to recharge. The auto function doesn’t work.

I have two very young children and two dogs, so cleaning the floors frequently is a must, but finding the time to do is it is hard! While this vacuum isn’t perfect (it will repeat areas and skip others), it overall does a great job. I run it once, sometimes twice a day, and the dust bin is always completely full... I honestly don’t know where it all comes from. The edge mode is better than I could have ever imagined I needed. The only thing I would change is the fact it does go over some areas more then once/skips some areas, and it does have a hard time finding home about half the time.Overall great purchase and would recommend to anyone!","Reviewed in the United States on June 19, 2019"

The run time mentioned as 110 Min, but my deebot runs at least 150 min or more before it runs out of battery.2. Adding the Deebot to App on Iphone didnt worked, but when I added using Android, I can see it from my iphone.3. I would really like it to have a virtual wall, as my deebot tries to go near fire place and it cannot climb the 1 inch marble in-front of fire place and gets stuck for few seconds before it turns back.","Reviewed in the United States on June 19, 2019"

I literally have to vacuum every single day, often twice a day, to keep up with the amount of black hair my cat leaves on my white bedroom carpet, but who has time to pull out the vacuum twice a day? This little Deebot has been a sanity saver! It has a remote control, but a manual control on the appliance as well. I hit the ""Go"" button on the remote when I get up in the morning and by the time I'm dressed and ready for work, my bedroom carpet is clean! Sometimes when I come home in the evening, my carpet has wads of hair where she has rolled around and played, so I have to run it again, and by the time I'm changed out of my work clothes, the rug is good to go.The dirt storage compartment is so easy to pop out and empty! I thought it had an issue once, because it was rolling right over the hair, not picking it up, but then I realized the roller was full of hair. I had to manually clean the brush with my fingers, but it was easy and only took a few seconds.  Also, it's only happened a couple of times in the few months I've had it.I also bring it into other rooms of my house and let it run around and vacuum, while I clean. It's been great on my hardwood floors, so while I'm wiping down the counters, stove and washing dishes, it takes care of the floor for me!  I can't say it's good for deep cleaning, that hasn't been my purpose (I have a carpet cleaner for that) but for all of my carpet surface cleaning (dirt, hair, debris, etc) it's been excellent!This has been one of the best purchases I have made in a long time!

One interesting note is that with use it does polish the floors after a few uses. When setting up your wifi you must be on the 2.4 hz band.

Keeping with their promise, they sent us a brand new unit, the Deebot N79S. Within 6 months (November '18-May '19), the main brush motor went out on the unit. Because it was over a year from the original purchase, they will not fix this unit, and I can not get parts for it. They are still making the unit, so the parts exist, they just won't send them. I've had email conversations, called, and even used the chat function on the website and they will not send me the part. I can fix it myself, even though the unit is less than a year old. They keep telling me to wait for their repair shop to open, sometime this quarter. Why would I pay you all to fix something less than a year old, that I can fix myself.

"2647","I ordered this unit almost a year ago, and I am so pleased with it!  It is imperative that you follow all cleaning and operating instructions to get the best performance out of it.  I named mine Dobie, and he vacuums my apartment twice a week.  The first few times I used my bot, I was stunned at how much dust and dirt it collected from under large furniture items and under my bed.  My place has all hardwood floors, but I do have to pick up the few throw rugs I use in the bathroom and bedroom (or he tries to eat them).  All in all, a wonderful purchase.Update--Jan 2020. My Deebot is still working well. Only change is that it returns to charging base after running an hour. It used to vacuum for 90 minutes. Since it is over 2 and a half years old, that seems reasonable. If/when mine dies, I definitely intend to get another one, same brand and model. As for people who get freaked out trying to connect the unit to wifi, or running it while not at home, that is your fault. Don't expect this unit to perform any differently than a manual upright vac. You have to prep your space to use it effectively. And clean it properly after every use.","Reviewed in the United States on June 14, 2019"

The Deebot function perfectly, did not damage my hardwood floors and picked really well all of my puppy hair (that was the main purpose) for about 9 months. However, the unit suddenly stopped working and according to the manual, the sound it was doing was related to a problem with the brush. After cleaning it and doing everything recommended, the unit still did not work so I bought a replacement kit, changed the brush and still nothing. This was just the begging of the must tedious process up to date!Multiple people get involved (over 4 at this point) in the same line of communication so no true follow up exist. They kept repeating and asking for the same information over and over again. When it’s confirmed that the product had a malfunction and still under warranty they said, in a not so friendly tone, that if I did not ship the defected unit they will not send the replacement. Since I’m out of the country and they did not provide a prepaid international shipping guide (only ground), I’m not able to send it right away. So, at this point, I need to travel (or someone) to the US soon so they can ship it or i will not get my new unit (of a product that is still under warranty).For me, is the last time I buy anything from this company and no more recommendations to friends and family.","Reviewed in the United States on June 12, 2019"

"2665","I spent months researching and reading reviews on robot vacuums. I knew people who had iRobots, but I didn't want to spend that much money. I have twin toddlers and a dog who emits joy fluffs on a constant basis. After reading a few reviews on Amazon, one in particular ended up being our experience as well. We got one Deebot, we didn't pick up the area rugs and turned him on. We were amazed at how much he picked up, since we had swept just the day before. He easily avoided the stairs, he cleaned our area rugs, we have one low pile and the other a little longer. Our children are in love with it as well. They love watching him and try to decide where he's going to go. It also prompts them to pick up their toys, because they don't want Deebot to eat it. After three days we bought a 2nd one for our upstairs. We do have a thick rug in our children's room which my Shark has a problem with. Deebot did go over it, but when he tried to edge around it he got stuck. This was more than what I thought he was going to do and we easily pick it up for him. He goes under most of our furniture, we did have one couch that was low, which we got longer legs for, so we don't have to move it around for him to get under it. We love our Deebots and he does a great job cleaning up after our toddler's messes and the dog joy fluffs. If we run them every day we don't have to worry about emptying the collection tray mid-cleaning.","Reviewed in the United States on June 12, 2019"

It is especially problematic on recliners, but anything that is close to the clearance height of the top of the device will hang it up.

This thing is amazing.  I thought my upright vac was doing a great job, and to test it, I swept the floors before i sent the deebot on it' maiden journey.  I have two rooms with carpet and the rest is hardwood or vinyl.  Oh wow, the deebot STILL picked up dog hair and ""stuff"" off the floors I had just swept!I can ask Alexa to ""Tell Deebot to start cleaning"" and that works too!  It's pretty handy.I won't lie, it's gotten itself stuck numerous times, but it's been because I've left something on the floor for it to get caught up on.  A cord or shoelace will disable it if it gets wrapped around the wheels.The app works great as well.  I can check the status anytime I need to.I had to move the dock a couple of times to make sure I was giving the deebot a clear path.  I finally found the perfect spot and I've not had to physically take it to the dock since.I've had this a month and it is still picking up dog hair and stuff out of the carpet.  Not as much, but it's still very effective.I did have to call customer service, and they were very helpful and more than willing to assist.

"2683","This product is great and cleans our hardwood floor and miscellaneous area carpets (very low pile carpets).  I have owned this for over six months now and can say it does a great job of picking up the dirt, hair and dog fur (short haired dog).  This product was designed to work on the surfaces I have and the description was very clear that it will not work on other surfaces besides those described.  It works just as expected.  It does a great job of picking up the huge majority of everything we usually have on the floor.  While not a replacement for regular vacuuming and mopping, it sure cuts down on the mess.  It does a good job at getting into tight areas that aren't usually cleaned with a regular mop or vacuum.  The family loves watching it go around.  The dog is a little concerned with it invading her house, but keeps her distance.  It is easy to maintain and clean.  Only a couple of quirks encountered so far.  One is replacement brushes by the company on Amazon, don't seem to be the same size as the originals.  Two, when the power goes out the robot, if left on auto, will leave its docking station and start searching for it until the power comes back on.  That has lead us to searching the house for the robot when we returned home at the end of the day when the power had apparently been out for several hours.  Just seems odd that it needs the base station to be powered on all the time after it is docked.  Don't let those two minor things keep you from buying this robot.  It is a great value for the price and performs just as I expected, at a fraction of the price when compared to competitors.","Reviewed in the United States on June 10, 2019"

Seriously you’ll thank yourself later. Buy it. It’s worth it.","Reviewed in the United States on June 7, 2019"

We don’t have any pets so we don’t have a problem with a lot of hair but it didn’t last long at all.  It’s been six months and now it does work well.

"2713","I made the cardinal sin of buying my wife a vacuum for her birthday. Luckily, she is a bit of a tech geek (as long as it works anyway) so when I saw this was on sale I figured why not? Honestly, it has been one of the best things I have ever bought her! She loves it! She can set a schedule for it to run, she can launch it from her phone wherever she is and it just runs. We have my wife and two daughters with long hair and two dogs (1 sheds, 1 doesn't) and hardwood floors throughout. This thing does a good enough job that my wife has gone from vacuuming the floors every other day to maybe once a week! The only drawback is that the hair accumulates in the rolling wheel that causes an error. It also gathers on the spinning brush that causes an error. It also gets in the bumper and disrupts the sensor that causes an error. It's not that bad though...15-20 minutes cleaning the hair from the vacuum and it's back to work, error free. It detects the drop off to the back room without issue. It detects the large objects (fridge, cabinets, etc.) with no problem. It doesn't detect dining room chair legs very well and gently bumps into them but does not leave a mark or any dings. My wife and I are very surprised at just how well this little unit works! Absolutely perfect for us! Now the vacuuming gets done when no one is home and my wife has more time for other things.","Reviewed in the United States on June 7, 2019"

Waiting to see what happens.We purchased this vacuum 11 months ago. It was a lifesaver with a newly mobile baby. It picked up hair, dirt, Cheerios, dog hair, nearly everything. I could schedule a daily clean time while we were out of the house and it would clean the entire first floor. I even used it in my physics classroom for a race. As months went on it got stuck more often but still got the job done. At month 11 the main brush will not turn. We’ve cleaned very thoroughly and replaced it but it still will not rotate.

The only issue I have had is even with the remote scheduled cleaning time off, it started remotely at 2:17 AM, several times but not every day. My husband said it was out to get him, lol.

It is a great was to conserve energy and simplify work. I use it for high traffic areas. It does not work on long/shaggy carpet. It gets stuck sometimes on the side of the coach.

"2731","Possibly the worst product I have ever bought on Amazon. Despite not being set to run automatically at all, it would wake itself up in the middle of the night, noisily vacuum around the house, and get into the fireplace and get tangled in rugs. No amount of adjusting or resetting the controls prevented this. Perhaps aware of its failings, the Deebot also tried to commit suicide by pitching itself down the stairs a couple of times during its midnight runs. Eventually it stopped working altogether. No good!","Reviewed in the United States on June 5, 2019"
"2732","I've had this vacuum for a month and I'm pretty impressed. We run it during the night (on the first floor) because our dog barks at it constantly if he's around it. We wake up to mostly clean hardwood floors! It doesn't map to the layout of the house so it kinda just zig zags around. I don't think it's quiet enough to run while you're watching TV but it's not as loud as a normal vacuum. The only part that drives me crazy is hearing it bump into furniture everywhere, however it actually does good at not scratching stuff. You also have to watch out for cords and thick floor vents, it can get stuck. Overall I think it's a great vacuum for cleaning dog hair and loose dirt!","Reviewed in the United States on June 5, 2019"
"2733","I've had some experience with robotic vacuums from bigger name brands in the past.  They mostly worked fine for a while, and before too long had components start to fail and batteries that wouldn't hold charge.  I've only had this vacuum for a few months now, but I'm blown away by it.  We only use it in our kitchen with linoleum floors, but its probably 250+ sq ft with a challenging geometry.Runtime:Battery life has been great.  We've seen 2+ hours on hard flooring.  I've tried timing the total runtime, but it's been so long that I've gotten bored and moved on to other things before it finished every time.Cleaning ability:The DEEBOT does a great job of removing everything from the floor.  We only run it about once a week, so the dust bin needs to be emptied after an hour or so of cleaning.  Having a larger dust bin would be nice, but it really does pack the dirt in there making an efficient use of the small space.Features:+Quiet operation.  Not nearly as loud as the previous robovac we had.  We can easily watch TV or listen to the radio in the next room.+Ease of use.  Press one button on the remote to clean.  Two buttons to return to home.-App support.  I haven't tried using the app as it requires permissions that I am not comfortable sharing for a Chinese made vacuum.  I'm not someone who is overly concerned about privacy, but I don't understand why a vacuum would be requesting the permissions it does.  Cannot comment on app functionality-The remote scheduling only allows setting one time, and it occurs every day.  It would be nice to be able say ""vacuum every tuesday"", but that is not possible without app support-Same goes for different cleaning modes.  The DEEBOT has an edge clean mode which will circumnavigate the the edges of the room making sure to deep clean areas that collect dust.  It is not possible to schedule edge clean mode with the remote.The positives far outweigh the negatives, and I highly recommend this vacuum to anyone thinking about jumping into the robovac arena.  We use one in the kitchen now, and when we finally install hard flooring in our sunroom we will definitely be getting a second one.  I wish I felt comfortable using the app so I could operate it through Alexa, but that really is a minor concern.  I'm just glad I don't have to get out the big vacuum and do this room by hand anymore.","Reviewed in the United States on June 5, 2019"

Apparently you have to pay an extra $100 for it to have any idea where it's going or to complete a straight line. It will start running the length of the room and just stop and turn in the middle, usually to go back over that same swatch it's done 5 times already. You're hoping it cleans everything but you are relying on nothing short of dumb luck and SO MUCH TIME. I've had it too long now but if I could get my money back I would.

Then it seemed to go completely blind, just reeling around the house, smashing off baseboards and my antiques.I called and the technician suggested I “hit it really hard ten times” on the very front. When it continued its tight circles, she encouraged me to “ hit it REALLY hard again!! Ten more times”. Depressed that my physical abuse did not cure my poor drunken Deebot, she kindly sent a box out for me to send it back; however wouldn’t send a new one until mine was received.All in all, I waited about a month and started to miss my destructive yet entertaining Deebot.

I have set this up to run everyday at 4:00 pm and it is restricted to the same area as the pets. It is quiet enough that after the first couple of days it does not bother the pets at all. I was a little concerned that it’s random motion pattern would not get everywhere but it really get the whole floors clean.  Before this we had resigned our selves to the pets tracking in dirt and clippings, and my wife was always glad of having a clean floor for aday whenever we would vacuum and wet mop every week, now the floor is cleaner than it has ever been every day because dirt never gets a chance to accumulate. It has been 3 months now and I could not be happier.  I had to make a couple adjustments to make sure it would not get stuck on cords on the bedroom floor, but now we come home every day and it is back in it’s dock recharging. The only thing I would like is for the app to allow multiple deebots to be able to be controlled by alexa instead of just a single deebot. We use this on hardwood floors and berber and short pile carpeting, but it might have problems with deep piles. It works wonders on hard floors and short carpet though.","Reviewed in the United States on June 4, 2019"

If we leave the power on and it’s on the charger, it decides to clean at random hours (usually in the middle of the night).  We’ve turned it off to clear any accidental presets and we’ve unplugged it, all per instructions.  But it insists on these middle of the night missions, waking up people and the dog.

"2766","I've had this thing for a while now, and with proper bristle maintenance this robot does a fantastic job at keeping my tile floors clean. Even gets over small lips in door frames to get into different rooms. If the area you want it to clean is massive, it's probably going to miss spots. Ensure you pick up all loose wires and small objects on the floor, or it could get stuck. The way I think it works is it cleans in all directions it can until its battery runs low. In my small apartment, it cleans everything for 2-3 hours in a half aimless, half articulated routine. I set it to go when I'm at work, and come home to a very clean floor. It's cleaner than I could ever have made it with a broom, I lack the patience to sweep for 3 hours straight. I have no pets or kids, though. This robot does not like wet floors, but it'll still clean them. It's not that loud for a robot, but it's not quieter than a running sink. I've only found it off its charger once; The power went out for half the day and it moved around and tried to find the IR signal the charger emits. If you cut power to its charger, it will begin to look for a powered charger until you tell it otherwise - until it dies.","Reviewed in the United States on June 1, 2019"

It does a good job with spot cleaning, rugs, matts, and edges. It picks up all the junk and hair! The downside is that it only follows a random path so for an open concept house it will jump between rooms. Wish it could do a little better around corners but cant complain! This has saved me so much time and energy! Wish the had a deep scrubbing robotic mom (no pads) as well!","Reviewed in the United States on May 29, 2019"

It vents from the top so there is no negative airflow blowing the hard away.  It's grabs the hair with the brushes and collects it neatly.  It's been a fantastic addition to our arsenal.  It also does a great job around the chairs and stools.  The hair that used to stick to the felt pads on each leg is no more.

I have many pets, including a Husky and 2 cats, and it cleans up all their types of hair.  I went from vacuuming several times a week, with tumbleweeds accumulating in the days in between, to vacuuming with my upright only once since I purchased this.  It gets behind my couches, which I would otherwise rarely vacuum behind, and transitions from my area rugs to tile floors with ease.  I set it up to go when I leave for work and it sends itself back to it’s charging dock when it’s done.  The only thing I have to do is empty it’s contents daily.  I have run it a few times while I was home and I can hear it, but it’s no worse than what my washer/dryer sounds like.  The only thing I would say before you purchase it is to make sure you have an area free of furniture and obstacles where you can set up the docking station.

"2830","I. Hate. Cleaning. Anything that lessens my time spent sweeping, mopping, vacuuming or dusting is worth its weight in gold to me. I have a messy boyfriend, messy kid and a hairy fur-and-kibble-dropping dog, so before I bought this robot, I was constantly frustrated at how dirty my floors were, even immediately after I swept. I hated cleaning because - well, let's be honest here! - I seriously resented how my family would just waltz right on in, oblivious that I had just mopped or swept, with their muddy dirty shoes, or leave the door open for leaves and crap to blow in, or ignore the dog slobber drips and kibble crumbs and walk right through it instead of cleaning it up. While this vacuum can't really fix the wet messes - dog slobber, drips of soda, juice, wet sticky mystery substances, spaghetti sauce (ughhhh) - it handles just about everything else. (Maybe my next search should be to see if Ecovacs makes a mop-bot yet!)I bought this in July 2018, and have now had it almost a year. I purchased right before my floors were upgraded from bare, unsealed concrete (yes we really lived on that floor for years and it was awful) to wood-grain laminate. At first I was concerned that this might not pick tiny dust and dirt up from the concrete floor - but it did really well. Then, I was worried that the plastic sweeping brushes might cause static build-up and maybe wouldn't pick the fine dog hair up off the laminate flooring - but it surprised me. There doesn't seem to be any problem with static, even almost a year in.I have given this poor machine ZERO maintenance other than emptying the collection bin and occasionally pulling off the brushes and removing long strands of hair (mine) that have collected around the base. I have not even replaced the filters - I just take them outside once in awhile and give them a tap against a brick to knock some of the built-up dirt off. I wouldn't recommend this approach (you should definitely give it a little more care/maintenance than I have), but I am impressed with how well it has held up with zero effort. This poor robot has been kicked, pushed, and bumped many times and still continues to do its job with the same efficiency as always.It picks up my boyfriend's gross, coarse, long beard hairs (I cringe whenever I see them because they remind me of a different kind of body hair that, thankfully, he doesn't actually shed! LOL). It picks up the dog's short, straight hairs that usually stick to the floor with static electricity, as well as her fine undercoat that is now shedding after winter. It even picks up the inevitable hoardes of tiny little black ants that come inside in the Spring thru every crack and crevice searching for crumbs (even when there are none!)... and although I'm sure many of them just crawl out when the vacuum goes to dock for charging, I like to think that they die a dusty, slow death. I do seem to see fewer of them along my floors and baseboards after using this robot. It may just temporarily disrupt their little paths, but either way - death to house ants!Pros:- Inexpensive, compared to name brands like Roomba- Good quality for the price- Durable; has held up well with little to no maintenance- Convenient- Reduces my annoyance w my messy family!- As long as you run it regularly, it does a good job (not intended for heavily soiled areas)Cons:- Collection bin/tray is pretty small; must empty after each use (hope this company will eventually make one with the auto-empty bin like Roomba introduced last year!)- Kind of loud - definitely nowhere near as loud as a traditional vacuum, but still loud enough to annoy me when I'm watching TV or napping (so I tend to turn it on as I'm leaving the house - so I don't have to listen to it at all!)- Sometimes gets stuck under a certain piece of furniture that's just tall enough for the front bumper to get under, but not tall enough for it to move around (I could probably fix this by setting up a barrier but it doesn't happen that often)","Reviewed in the United States on May 24, 2019"

I made the mistake like 10 times before learning to just not be lazy and wipe those up myself. It’s nice because I went from sweeping/vacuuming everyday to just vacuuming what I now call a deep clean where I get my corners and baseboards like every other month. Which when you have babies and toddlers that extra 20 minutes of vacuuming is enough to push you over the edge to tears. I can’t recommend this thing enough. As a side note it’s not a silent vacuum.

Very convenient. Lacks some of the convenience of vacuu bot royalty such as planned routes, self charging, bla bla bla cannot afford those anyway so why compare.Deebot is a good homey. Deebot does get hungry and tries to eat thinner cloth or paper like items if left in its path. Usually ends up dragging em around like a cape so at least its entertaining. Anyway, cant go wrong, much cheaper than a maid or uptight highfalutin roombas. Besides Sir Deebot did a better job than the maid was doing anyway, at least he keeps working.","Reviewed in the United States on May 22, 2019"
"2854","Excellent purchase.  I have 1100 sq ft of laminate on my main floor and it covers it all. Living room, sun/play room, kitchen, dining, hall, and a small bath.  My rooms are moderately combined, but still separate spaces.  We use Deebot almost daily and it really does a great job.  I have a 6yr old and 2yr old that like to trace the house while stepping on goldfish crackers and pretzel shards.  Deebot does a great job, reducing the number of times we have to vaccuum and saving a lot of family time honestly.  We do not have pets.I do not recommend running at night.  Bit loud and we have 2 spots it likes to get stuck, at which point it beeps loudly.  We run after supper / during bedtimes.  Runs for about 2ish hrs.","Reviewed in the United States on May 22, 2019"

Ecovacs refused to replace the unit because there was a 12-month warranty, and their position was that since, between the two vacuums, I'd gotten 19 months of use, they had no further obligation. To make matters worse, though they assured me that they were ""just about to open"" a repair center, there's NO WAY TO GET THIS REPAIRED at present.

"2883","March 2020 update. Well, I've given up. It's now just a $160 doorstop. It worked great for 6 months. Back in December I contacted customer support. Two of the three people who replied were obviously just giving me their rehearsed response. One actually responded to my issues. They had me do a reset which consists of holding the start button until it beeps 3 times, release that button, turn it off and on, then run as usual. It seemed to help after doing this many times. I think I had a week where it ran normally. Now that resent does not help at all and it is not picking up very well either. Since I gave up on it I let my husband take it apart. There were no clogs anywhere and nothing that looked like it could be repaired. So, lesson learned. I'm saving up for a Roomba.Dec. 2019 update. For the last month or so my beloved Dee has been stopping for no apparent reason. I keep this VERY clean. I empty the bin and clean the filters daily. I purchased extra filters so I can change them out and wash them. I also remove any fibers or hair that become entangled around the brushes. For the first 15-20 minuets it stops and beeps like it is caught on something, but it's not. After that it runs fine. I have to say I am very disappointed. It ran so well for the first 6 months.I have been using my Deebot for a few weeks now and I could not be happier! I read many reviews before purchasing and I believe I had realistic expectations of what this little machine could and could not do. This is the low end of the robot vacuum spectrum. It does not do room mapping. I think some of the negative reviews expected too much and should have bought a more sophisticated machine. I just wanted something to vacuum my hard floors all on 1 level, no stairs.I was a little bit concerned that my very dark floors would be a problem. But Dee has done well. My area rugs are also dark so it does not see a contrast there. Sometimes it gets on to the area rugs and sometimes it does not. But that's okay with me. I just want the dust and cat hair that float around the floors gone and it does a fantastic job. I do the rugs with a more powerful vacuum. About once a week I get into the areas that Dee can not. That was my plan. But now that Dee is sucking up all that dust and cat hair every day there is much less in the areas that are blocked off from it. As a bonus it gets under my china cabinet. I've been battling some very persistent spicers for years and Dee has been victorious! He gets the crumbs under the toe kick area of my kitchen cabinets, another constant battle. He also fits under my sofa and loveseat. My other vacuums do not. I had to move the furniture to get under those. If I want him to get under my curtains I tuck them up under the blinds that day. If not he cleans around them. Yes he bumps into things. This is how he finds his way around. He is suppose to do that. He has not damaged anything, even my newly painted white baseboards. His bumper works well. Often as he approaches a wall he detects it and turns around. I guess the contrast of my dark floors and white baseboards and light beige curtains are what lets him detect them. Although he has several settings I set a time so each day he does his work then finds his way back home. Yes, he sometimes gets stuck on something, but not often. I close doors to bedrooms and bathrooms. I just want my living, dining and kitchen floors done. He is more quiet than any of my other vacuums, yes I have a few. But it's a vacuum. It's not silent. I'll try to post a video soon.After using Dee for a few days I got out my cordless Hoover and vacuumed as usual. I bought the Hoover just for the hard floors when I had less of them. It has a great light on the front that shows dust I can not otherwise see. I was shocked at how clean my floors were. Dee is my hero. That Hoover is a rock star too, but that's another story. I still have to push it around which makes Dee my new best friend.These photos show Dee parked in my dining room, recharging after a hard day's work, how dark my floors are, and some areas he does not fit into. I did not expect him to morph into a 2"" machine and vacuum around my tchotchkes. Guess I'm just nice that way. When company is coming I put him in the laundry room. I'm fine with his home in my dining room. It's very much out of the way and mostly unseen unless we are having company.I could ramble on even longer but I hope you get the idea. If you want room mapping and auto emptying buy a more expensive model. If you just don't want to have to vacuum your floors everyday hire Dee. He's worth every penny. Oh, he comes with his own remote control and you can download an app for your smartphone. I have enough apps on my phone. With this remote I see no reason to get the app. Or maybe I'm missing some added features with the app? I don't know. Happy less vacuuming everyone!","Reviewed in the United States on May 20, 2019"

"2889","I studied robotvacs for months before deciding on this one for 2 reasons. 1. I only expected her to run on my hardwoods and her reviews for that were great, 2. The price. So let me put her job into perspective. We have a little modest home about 1500 sq. ft. Of which only our 3 bedrooms are carpeted. We have 2 boys, a medium sized dog, and I have an in home daycare so add 6 more children, Mon.-Fri..For the first two weeks I only allowed her on the hardwoods, closing off the bedrooms because I didn't expect much of her on my carpets, and I have a Shark Vacume that I use for my good heavy duty cleaning. She has done amazing, running once to twice a day. Quiet enough to run during naptime, picks up all of the dog hair, sand from the sandbox, and grass clippings that are carried in on tiny feet that go in and out throughout the day, and the massive amount of crumbs that fall during Lunch/snack time. She even gets under my couch!!! I no longer have to swiffer under there, she gets it all.So after the first two weeks, and being confident in her abilities, I opened up my bedroom door to give her a try on my carpet. Now this isn't a deep cleaning vacuum. I still feel the need to break out my Shark Pro vacuum about once a week. But I will say she does a pretty darn good job. The first two times she ran under my bed (a spot I rarely am able to clean under) she filled up her dust bin. It was mind blowing what she was picking up.She now has free range over my house, runs about an hour and a half to 2 hours at a time. Now she is a little all over the place, there isn't a lot of logic to her cleaning, but I dont care. She manages to get to job done, and I didn't spend $400 on a robotvac!!!

"2893","Bought two N79 units when Amazon had them on a promoted sale for §149. LOVE them! Did follow it around on first run to identify areas where it could choke on extension cords/wires/low clearances and re-positioned obstructions/interferences as needed. We have low-pile oriental rugs and wood floors, and raised lintels between rooms, and Deebot handled all of these fine with flying colors. There is a stairs down to family room and Deebot edge detection successfully avoided falling down the stairs. Ecovacs Android wifi app works good although Deebot goes offline sometimes so I am going to try repositioning my Eero wifi living room beacon and/or reposition Ecovacs charging station so that Ecovacs and Eero are closer to each other, but basically very happy with Ecovacs app too. Repositioning Ecovac closer line-of-sight did not fix this intermittent offline status in the Android app which causes app to lose contact with Ecovac for a few minutes now and then. So far that's my only qualm with this Ecovac N79S.  UPDATE:  I found that simply by navigating to ""About"" on the app somehow ""wakes up"" the app and gets the vacs to read ""on-line"" in the app, so the app problem is solved.UPDATE: I want to give this 6 stars because of they way the robot handles large objects that you would expect would jam it ... but they DON'T jam it !  Whenever I empty the dust bin of the ECOVACS N79S I find all kinds of large objects - 4 inch segements of rose stems, champagne metal cap, beer caps, large shards of glass (up to 1"" across), sticks, small pebbles, small screws nuts and bolts (from work I was doing around house on electrical outlets) and NONE of these things on many vacuum runs has ever even once jammed up the robot ... and when I clean the robot dust bin I can just dump these large objects out of the vacuum robot ... they seem to just sit somewhere behind the dust bin but well away from the rollers and so therefore so far it seems nothing except a low clearance just slightly below the 3"" this robot needs can stop this robot ... otherwise it just keeps going, and going, and going .....Our floors have never been so clean!

"2896","I got this a few weeks ago, I had been wanting one for awhile. I was constantly vacuuming, I have a German Shepherd, 2 cats and then my daughter and I so there is literally hair everywhere.  My daughter decided it needed a name and Gerry was it. Gerry does a great job, I do empty him alot, but he does a lot of vaccuming. He goes under the couch, under, the dressers, ect. Absolutely amazing. I have this paranoia about letting Gerry work when we are not home, we've read the horror stories online about robo vacuums rynning over dog poo. So I only let him work while I'm here. It happen anyway though, my dog is well trained, but he does get sick on occasion today was one such day and I took Gerry apart and cleaned him. Lucky for me my dog ate a wipe, gross I know! But it made Gerry get stuck and he screamed for help (well he beeped) until I went to see what happen. The wipe got caught preventing the spread. My dog the night before had popped the child safetly lock on the the bathroom, which of course is to prevent him from going in there in order to get to the litter box and cat food. I guess he decided a wipe was a good idea too. Thankfully I had ordered some extra parts for Gerry and had them already. My one complaint about the design on this, which wont matter if you don't have children to spill things or pets to make messes is that when youbtakenit apart, all the electrical components are attached to the bottom. The bottom is what I needed to clean. Gerry is clean now and doing his job though, had he not got caught on something though I would have had poop spread about my house. Also we have a chair in the living room that Gerry gets stuck on daily.

Now, I get it right every time :) ...See my 1st picture.Update TIP 2: Someone asked about how much space the recharge needs. The booklet says it needs several feet on each side, BUT (see my 2nd picture), I was able to lay some old linoleum on the carpet for the unit to unite smoothly with the charger. You will see that it does not need a wide berth.I was one who thought a robot vacuum was a silly idea. I was vacuuming with my powerful Dirt Devil Jaguar Pet Vac about once a week. Each time, I would have to empty the canister two or three times.Then, BestBuy and Amazon had a price war during Mother's Day week of 2019. Both had dropped the price from around $249 to $159.  I had $50 in BestBuy gift cards doing E-Rewards surveys, so my cost was $109 (plus taxes).I figured if I didn't like it, I could give it away.I am hooked. After 4 days of daily cleaning, I noticed that the N79S was picking up less dirt. Then, I took my DareDevil Jaguar vacuum and did the whole house. This time, the canister was only HALF full. WOW! Now, I just do other stuff, like write this review, while the N79S hums along (not very noisy, unless you select power cleaning mode, which gets a bit louder, but not annoying).  And, you can select spot cleaning (it goes into concentric circles), or edge cleaning (it follows all the edges of a room/house), and more.The 4 stars for 'deep cleaning' is because the Dirt Devil Jaguar vacuum does a better job of sucking up trapped and deeper embedded sand/dirt at the carpeted area.PS, I noticed that it kept starting at midnight, until I read that you take the remote control and hold the Timer button (the top left, next to the round clock symbol, under the arrows) for a few seconds until it beeps or the Timer symbol on the remote screen disappears.Finally, the Jaguar Pet vacuum is now in hibernation :)  If you want to decide to get a robot vacuum, this one is a very good beginner's model.","Reviewed in the United States on May 17, 2019"

"2913","I've had this robot vacuum for about 3 weeks.  I like it, but there are a few concerns.  I came very close to returning the product, because I couldn't get it to work with my wifi.  I clicked on the link for support through Amazon, and they  tried to contact the supplier with no response.  They said they would continue to try, but I never heard back from them. .  What I realized is that it really doesn't need the internet .  It comes with a remote control that works very well and I have learned to love this option.  I have a very large house (1st floor about 2000 sq ft ) and it runs randomly.  It has very strong suction and if you use the remote option to clean the edges, it works most amazingly.  I am retired and at home most of the day, so if it misses a spot, I just redirect it with the remote.  When I empty the dirt container, I am amazed at how much it picks up.  It is also very quiet compared to my daughter's Roomba and that's exactly why I purchase this instead of a Roomba.  It is also smaller, so it fits nicely under beds, couches, and chairs.  I have many low nap area rugs  and hardwood throughout the house and it goes from one to the other without a problem.  It also goes over door strips and edges very well.  It does find the charger from time to time, but not always, so I just use the remote to direct it to the port if it can't find it.  Overall, I really like this product, but it is a shame that it doesn't have a better mapping feature.  For the price, it does a great job.","Reviewed in the United States on May 16, 2019"

"2923","I love this robot. We have four dogs and the hair gets a little out of control sometimes but this vacuum has definitely cut down on the time I have to manually vacuum. There are a couple things about it that maybe could be addressed and may not be a problem with other robot vacuums, but the biggest thing is the brush getting clogged up. By design, these don't hold much in the dust bin but it would be nice if it could sense when it was full and then stop. If it gets full then it just keeps going and the main brush gets overwhelmed with hair until it eventually shuts itself off and starts beeping at you to clean it out. If you stay on top of it and just empty the bin every so often (depending on the hair level of your house) then that isn't an issue. It's kind of a pain to have to clean the hair out of it because it gets so tightly wound around it. Emptying the bin is a 10 second job so I have certainly tried to remember to empty that out while the vacuum is working.A couple other things is the smart home control is great. I just tell Google to start it or dock it and it responds quickly and easily. I do find myself using the remote or the direction controls in the Ecovacs app to get a few spots that the vacuum occasionally missed but that is rare if you leave it to sweep the duration of the battery (which is roughly 90 minutes or so in my experience).Overall, a really great device to have in the house. Cuts down on your cleaning time exponentially and compared to other vacuums, is a great value. Highly recommended!","Reviewed in the United States on May 15, 2019"
"2924","We have only had this for a day and OH MY has it cleaned quite a lot.Dust bunnies under my sofa, corners of my hallways, pet dander and hair, etc. We like it a lot so far.Settings: I have used the 'room perimeter' setting the most so far. 'Auto' setting is fine, though it travels randomly without really cleaning a whole room 100% before moving on. The 'one room' setting doesn't really work well for me, as we have an open floor plan main level.Cleaning: This thing really does clean well. It gets hair, dust, pet dander, and so on. So far, I notice it doesn't suck up heavy particles like litter or food well. The litter it sucked up fell out a bit when I empty the suction compartment. Otherwise, no complaints.Robot intelligence: Being as this is our first robot vacuum, we are quite satisfied with it. It does have an app with several nice features (alarm, suction power, a direct remote control to 'drive') and it comes with a remote control. I can see why other people would opt for something smarter, as this little robot just kind of goes hither and yon, not exactly 100% cleaning one location before moving on.Overall: For me, this is a great addition to my cleaning regime. I'm always home so far when I use it and I'll set it in the bedrooms I need cleaned or do my best to adjust it when it needs.Issues: It has gotten stuck a few times on one of my shag rugs. It tries to 'right' itself, but as long as I'm home to help it out, no problem. Today it managed to get stuck under my couch, which was a first. But I'm learning to leave openings for it to get under.Tip: You MUST clean small items, electrical cords, etc. from the floor before using this, just like with a regular vacuum.We are very happy with out new little robot maid!","Reviewed in the United States on May 15, 2019"

In fact, the remote really doesn't do anything at all. I didn't try the app on my phone, because I don't want to give it access to all of my storage contents. After the first run, I found that I have to ""help"" it more and more frequently (it isn't stuck or full, just stops moving, starts beeping, and I have to push the ""auto"" button every 5-10 minutes to get it restarted, which defeats the purpose of a robot vacuum).  I let it charge at least 24 hours between vacuums, but that doesn't seem to help. When it does work, it really does work. The bin collects a lot of dust/dirt and is easy to empty.

"2936","I researched robotic vacuums for a some time. I will admit, I am always the first customer to look at the 1 star category and read the negative first before proceeding. Usually, that makes me think twice (which most of the time is a good thing since I spend so much money on Amazon). The vacuum has a few poor reviews, but nothing like some of the other robo vacuums. I tend to strongly believe you pay for what you get. I went ahead took a swing and purchased the Deebot N75S and figured if it wasn't working to standards, I would return it and it wouldn't be a huge deal because I am spending a fraction of the cost compared to the roomba and other brands. After receiving the vacuum, everything was SUPER easy to setup/hookup. I set my vacuum to run at 9 o'clock every night, usually the time I prep for the next day of work. I was INSANELY impressed with how much it picks up. The amount of dust, hair, etc.. surprised me. Even one night, the vacuum picked up a few ants off my floor haha. You should raise cords like my iphone charger, etc.. but other then that, it's awesome. Trust me, this is worth every penny. The app even gives you a percent on when to replace the brushes, filter, etc. It seems to have no trouble going over my rugs and cleaning them also. I have to guide the vacuum to the home base, but everything else works great.Take the chance, skip the top expensive brand and go with Deebot!","Reviewed in the United States on May 14, 2019"

She’s probably the best money I’ve ever spent and not much makes me happier than coming home and emptying her little bin and knowing the floor is clean and I basically did no work at all. I live alone- no kids, no pets- and she’s set to automatically run every day. I’m regularly surprised by how much she picks up, every single time she runs. Where the heck does she find all that dust and dirt??All that awesomeness aside, I’m writing this review now because little Alice (that’s what I named the vacuum) met with a major disaster this past weekend.A good friend is moving and I hosted a going away party for her. My friend and her husband came to my house and brought their Greyhound. The party was outside but Alice and the dog stayed inside. Late in the night, doggy daddy went inside to check on his dog and came back out in a bit of a panic.“How do you turn Alice off?”, he asked.I was a little confused because her automatic run time is set for 10am. He asked again, with a bit more urgency, “Seriously. How do you turn her off??”I go inside my house to find a horrific scene. The very large Greyhound has made a VERY large pile of very wet poo....and Alice has been trying to clean it up. I won’t go into the details of how far and wide the poo had been stretched across my house- but it was bad. Really, really bad.Cleaning the floor and baseboards took quite a long time and we were exhausted. Alice was in bad shape and I really figured she would end up in the vacuum graveyard. I wiped her exterior and wrapped her in a towel to deal with in the morning.The next day I began the task of trying to fix my beloved Alice. I took her apart- side brushes, main brush and filter off and tried to brush away all the poo. It was EVERYWHERE and my brush wasn’t doing any good. I was frustrated and Alice was filthy. In a last ditch effort of desperation, I took my kitchen sink sprayer to her.  I didn’t think she would possibly survive but I had to give her a chance.I dried her out with a hair dryer and let her sit for a couple hours. I put her on her charger and she lit up! Could it be possible she was going to work again? No way, I thought. 24 hours later, little Alice is happily cleaning my floor again. Like nothing ever happened. I don’t know what she’s made from but if you’re looking for a robot vacuum, I absolutely recommend the Deebot. I was already in love with my Alice but after this weekend I will tell every single person I know. Buy the Deebot!!!

We named him Ultron (you can change the vacuum’s name in the app).He does the drunken sailor stumbling navigation around the house and he does a pretty good job of it. It’s impressive just how much stuff he picks up. With two kids, two cats, and two adults (one of whom has long hair), there’s a lot of fur/hair/debris that’s always being picked up.Ultron’s suction is pretty effective. He inhaled a Mardi Gras necklace, legos, and hair ties without batting a robotic eye.Now that my kids know Ultron will vacuum up there stuff, they’ve gotten quite speedy and picking up the floor when Ultron leaves his docking station and gives his “hello” chime.We run him during the day when I telecommute or on weekends where we can keep an eye on him. He gets stuck on things and we need to go save him (it’s cute at this point).  If our furniture were less challenging or we had fewer cords around the house, we could let him vacuum unattended without much issue.

This review is basically a comparison between these two vacuum models: Deebot N79s vs Roomba 805.Pros of Deebot: light weight, quiet, better docking.Cons: less suction power, and the most serious drawback imo is how it maneuvers the whole floor.I found it very easily to get stuck “by itself”, without any obstacles. If it gets stuck under dining table and chairs, fine, I can understand that. But what’s going on to get stuck in an open space??? Today it just got stuck in my kitchen for 30min and can’t find a way to get out. See the video attached. As a comparison I also ran Roomba in the same space, and it doesn’t have any problem to sweep the whole floor and finished that area in less than 2min. This is not the first time it gets stuck in open space, but just find it really ridiculous to get lost in such an open and clean area.

Then I put it in a different part of the house and let it to it’s thing while I’m doing some other errand. It’s one less thing I have to worry about!","Reviewed in the United States on May 11, 2019"
"2973","Okay I adored this thing the first few weeks we had it. It was programmable, quiet for the most part and did a pretty great job cleaning up our tile floors. Then it started to get stuck. EVERYWHERE. under cabinets, couches, really anywhere. Of course the machine doesnt have any easy fixes for this, so barring crazy gluing a higher barrier onto the machine... it will continue to get stuck under things and beep and beep all night. Definitely not impressed with the lack of customizable heights. (Unless I'm missing something, other readers/reviewers PLEASE help me out!)","Reviewed in the United States on May 11, 2019"

"2975","Great on carpet, great for deep cleaning, I have long hair and it picks up every bit of it. I don't have hardwood so I can't justify it. But it does get caught under my gaming chair but that's the only thing I can complain about","Reviewed in the United States on May 11, 2019"
"2976","I loved this machine with all of my heart and then it just petered out.  I can't get it to charge.  I'm going to buy one from a different brand so I can compare and contrast.  I think this could be an even better machine if the battery life issues could be worked out.","Reviewed in the United States on May 11, 2019"

"2979","This is a must have product if you have flat surface floors in your home or business.  I watched t navigate throughout my home on the first try to see if was capable and efficient in vacuuming small debris  as advertised.  After the first run, I was amazed with the amount of debris collected in an hour or so.  If you download the app as recommended, it allows you to use additional cleaning functions that expands its cleaning options /areas for your home.","Reviewed in the United States on May 11, 2019"
"2980","I love this vacuum !!!!  I am a single mom with three kids this has been the biggest help !!!!  Do yourself a favor and buy this vacuum :)I emoty rwo trays of junk from the vacuum every day","Reviewed in the United States on May 11, 2019"
"2981","It did okay while it lasted...which was only 8 months.  Always seemed to achieve a fairly full collection bin, but it would miss some larger debris like leaves.  I probably wouldn't buy again.","Reviewed in the United States on May 10, 2019"
"2982","Just got it today and I am loving it so far. It did amazing on our tile and hardwood. I will update when we try carpet.","Reviewed in the United States on May 10, 2019"
"2983","Does not work with ECOVACS app!Did a great job for the first couple of months.  Then it decided to keep getting stuck under furniture.  I would have to hunt for the thing when I'd get home from work.  Then I'd have to reset the time/timer (it wouldn't auto clean after the battery died).  After a year, it's now giving me the constant 4 beep error even after making sure it's clean, fully charging it, and resetting everything.For the price, it isn't bad, however, if I had to do it again, I would have spent the extra money on a good vacuum.","Reviewed in the United States on May 10, 2019"
"2984","My husband bought this for me for a mother day gift. I absolutely love it. I keep it. Hanging under my sofa since my toddler loves to play with it. It works great on diet/dust and dog hair. I’ve even found earrings and small toys inside while emptying it out. I have it programmed to run a few times a day so my floors stay nice and clean! It’s been able to vacuum my kitchen, living room and hallway multiple times on 1 charge.Cons: it’s gotten stuck a few times in my rug and from those 3 times the bristles are completely messed up and gone stray. It’s also a little noisier than I thought it would be. Lastly, a few times I’ve woken up to the Deebot in another room turned off because it got stuck on a carpet.Despite the cons I would recommend this product, it’s  great deal especially for the price!","Reviewed in the United States on May 10, 2019"
"2985","The product was working fine until it stopped in the middle of cleaning(I run it in the night and it usually returns to charging dock so from the way it was in the middle of the living room). I tried to troubleshoot with the customer rep who called back almost immediately after I called them and left a voicemail. He quickly decided it needs to be replaced and with in next 30 mins we exchanged warranty information over emails. I shipped it the same day I spoke to them and I had my new Deebot within a week.love the product and this customer service","Reviewed in the United States on May 10, 2019"

"2987","Do not buy this product, even after maintnacing, and cleaning it frequently it stopped working within a years timeframe. I’ve called their customer service several times and they stated they do not have a service shop in the US. They requested I hold on to it until they open a repair shop, only then will they fix it.","Reviewed in the United States on May 10, 2019"
"2988","Okay, I was SO excited to get this thing and I was completely let down. It runs into everything! Won’t vacuum my rugs, won’t even attempt to get on it. Never finds it home. Literally spends more time searching for its charging dock than it does actually cleaning the floors. Completely misses obvious crumbs, which is why I got it! I have an 11 month old and I thought it would come in handy with her messes but nope. It’s also extremely loud.I don’t know why other people are saying it’s quiet. Not sure what the hype is. Honestly easier to just sweep your own floors.","Reviewed in the United States on May 10, 2019"
"2989","We have pets, two cats, one is Ragdoll, and a bull terrier dog.  I wanted one of these to help with keeping the floors under control between me vacuuming.  This has really impressed me, it really vacuums, carpet and the tile floors (ours is bumpy tile!)  IT even cleans bathroom rugs!!!  That my dyson cannot clean, I always had to take them outside to shake.  This is going to improve our home cleanliness as well has it is really making me HAPPY!  I was going to spend much more, but my husband did some research and seen the reviews for this one.","Reviewed in the United States on May 10, 2019"
"2990","Great product so far.  Really picks up the husky hair.  Hopefully the husky does not destroy it while the two are alone during the day","Reviewed in the United States on May 10, 2019"
"2991","Love this thing. Every morning at 10 am it leaves its little dock and starts roaming the house picking up dust, dirt  and what have you. I really love the fact that it vacuums underneath the beds daily. It does occasionally get stuck under one of my end tables and my recliner. It also has lock itself in the bathroom a few times. The good really outweighs the bad and this will make any home cleaner.","Reviewed in the United States on May 9, 2019"
"2992","Really loved this for 4 weeks.  Unfortunately the bumper is malfunctioning and my support window has closed from the seller.  Order and received in November but disnt open until 4 weeks ago (had a major flood and wanted to wait to use it until renovation was done). Totally bummed.","Reviewed in the United States on May 9, 2019"

"2994","Great little machine, quite and strong, it does a great job. just be sure to program the deebot or it may visit you in the middle of the night. I know this is not the high end model, its does so good its hard to believe it could be better.","Reviewed in the United States on May 9, 2019"

"2997","We got this when it was one of Amazon's Deal of the days.  Seems to work great for the price we paid and what I need it to do which is pick up pet hair.  AND I must say that it really picks up the pet hair.  Sometimes though I feel like it goes in the same path so I may stand in front or move something so that it changes course and that's it. Nice Work!","Reviewed in the United States on May 9, 2019"

"3000","Holy cow this thing is amazing. Just bought a new house and as I worked on deep cleaning I let it run. It picked up sooooooo much stuff that I had no idea was on the floor. So far I've only seen it perform on wood floors. With a household of 7 I can use all the help I can get.","Reviewed in the United States on May 9, 2019"
