"5,""We've had Deebot for just over a year and a half. We don't use it as much as some people - it's more of a supplement for us when we don't feel like getting out the Kirby, so it gets run about 2-3 times a month at most. Otherwise it always lives in its cradle.About two months ago it stopped working. That is - it would run for a few minutes, then start beeping four beeps with a red light. Doing extensive internet research suggested that Deebot needed a good deep cleaning and possibly a new battery. I followed multiple videos to clean all the hair out of every wheel, nook, and cranny that existed, but still the same. So we shelled out the $25 for a new battery.And today I tried to run it for the first time after the new battery has been charging for several days... and once again, it went for a few minutes, stopped in the middle of the room not near anything, and started the four beeps.So I guess, if you shell out hundreds of dollars for this thing, be sure to understand that it is a """"disposable"""" product that will only last about 16 months, and then will be completely broken beyond repair, even if you follow the company's instructions and shell out additional money for a battery."",""Reviewed in the United States on September 23, 2020""";;
"6,""For those that don't want to read the entire report. DO NOT BUY if you intend on keeping it for a long-term use.I bought this Deebot 2 years ago, and finally decided to give it a review. For the first 9 months, the Deebot worked decently well for a family home and a shedding dog. We constantly cleaned it out after every use, which is expected since we ran it 3 times a week. We did have to slightly rearrange the house everytime since it does not have the capability to avoid most minor obstacles. Overall, we were pleased with the Deebot.Here is were it started to get frustrating as time went by. By 10 months it started having issues with the battery life and software. Imagine it cleaning a 1,500 sq ft area and then, dropping down to 750 sq ft area before it was triggerd it to find the charging port due to a low battery. This, from our observations, was a sharp decline in battery life. It was nearly an instant occurrence where it had issues cleaning.We replaced and cleaned the deebot accessories when needed or recommended by the app associated with the Deebot.By the 11th month, the software started to have issues. It would blink various stages of red and cease to clean. This is when we called customer service to get a replacement. We followed various cleaning and troubleshooting instructions before they decided to replace it. Nothing out of the ordinary for companies to do. However, we had to send in the old Deebot before receiving a replacement. Once it was sent, it took a number of weeks to recieve the replacement.They sent us a refurbished Deebot as a replacement and we immediately had issues with the Deebots software. It would randomly blink red and beep when charging (generally within the first 10 minutes of charging), try to go over obstacles rather than avoid them, and still had battery half-life battery. It was as if, they decided to give me a replacement of my old one with additional issues. Granted, it did clean the area until the battery was low this time. When we called, it was too late! We were over the 12 month warranty and all they could do, or want to do, was buy a new one or we had to pay to get it fixed. Low and behold, we stuck with it for a year with all it's issues to at least use it until it is ready to be in the grave.We are now in the market to buy another vaccum. They have been a lifesaver when it comes to sweeping hairs and miscellaneous nonsense. Plus, I feel it does a better job sweeping than myself.Nevertheless, having a robo-vaccum has been a 1st world saver for reducing time and ensure a decent clean. Would I get a Deebot again... NO I wouldn't. This time I am looking for quality product and a company that will stand behind it with more than just a one year warranty.Why???Because I take care of my stuff with the expectation that it will last for years. This obviously does not possess qualities that will last.FYI, the 2 deebots we have had have normal wear and tear from bouncing of objects and what have you. They were not abused, damaged, or tinkered with. However, a few nights ago the Deebot decided to force its way through an area that has a lip under the dishwasher. When I mean forced, it used all its might and power to get under there. It wasn't until I went in the Kitchen because I heard it in the kitchen longer than it normally does. When I pulled it out, trying to inflict the least damage to the device and appliance, the result is in the picture."",""Reviewed in the United States on September 23, 2020""";;

I still have not been able to send my machine back.I would have rather spent the extra money getting a more reputable company that doesn't let their customers go through a grace period of 9 months without a working machine.

They absolutely refuse to tell me whether replacing the battery will help, or if there are any troubleshooting options. They claim that replacing the battery is a safety issue. It really isn't. The battery is clearly designed to be user replaceable and they sell them on Amazon, but support refused to say whether that might help or not.

Lastly.. this robot is so dumb that it will literally take 15-20 mins to find the charging station (even if it is in the middle of a wide open living room) and 8 out of 10 times it won’t find it so you will have to go on a hunt for the robot all over the house wherever it died and pick it up to put it in the charging station.. other than that it is great for the price."",""Reviewed in the United States on September 9, 2020""";;

First, ECOVACS cannot communicate well with a customer. They wait days or weeks to respond, do not read previous conversation or have forgotten the issue by the time they respond, and don't seem to understand their own vacuums. They troubleshot my issue wrong with multiple people on multiple occasions and will sometimes promise to help and other times tell you to use the 3rd party repair shop that they have no affiliation with...sure. Now, I end up with a vacuum that works okay but once fully charged beeps incessantly. I would donate the thing, though I don't wish it on anyone.

"62,""The Deebot for the most part works. I didn't realize what random floor cleaning ment  because I had an older vacuum bot that mapped the areas. This one goes straight until it bumps into something and then makes a slight right turn until it bumps into something and then may go right or left. It goes until the battery is dead, not until your room is clean. In fact, it might miss parts of your room. The FAQ's day to run the Bot more often to get more areas. The bin is good for 1 run only maybe 2 if you do it frequently, that was not like my old one also. But my real frustration is the APP and connection related to CUSTOMER SERVICE. For some reason, my home Wifi can control every appliance except this one. The APP won't connect to the bot and therefor I can't use all the features like Google Home starting or HIGH Suction (that feature is not on the physical remote). I have been back and forth with Megan Finnerty of support providing the same info over and over. They told me they would escalate the issue and I've yet to be contacted. This is now a 2 month issue. I have provided Port information that my provider blocks but for some reason, ECOVACS will not tell me the answer. They want to send me a new one but the whole thing works if connected to my phone hotspot, so it's not the device. It needs an advance tech person to answer info on ports.

At first I though that it was the main brush itself, so I bough a new one and replaced it. But that wasn't the issue.

"76,""I have bought three of these Deebots. One was for my house and we liked it so much that we bought my mom and my wife's mo one too.This is great for cleaning up after dinner when everything falls under the dinner table. It takes some time to get around all the table and chair legs but it cleans everything up good.We usually run it in our living room, dining room, and hallway once every couple of days. Sometimes we turn it on before we leave the house and when we get home it's vacuumed about 95% of the rooms we let it into. Most of the time we find it back in its charger but there's been a couple of times it couldn't find it's way back and the battery dies. That's only happened 3 times. Usually, it gets stuck under the dining room table cause it can't get around all the legs.Our cleaning day is on Saturday morning. We put this in each room and close the door. After 10 min it's all done. We have rabbits so every couple of nights we let it run in the living room and it picks up a lot of fur. The suction is very strong cause I've found legos, pens, pencils, and markers when I empty it out.The dust collector is small but if you don't have pets, you can probably run it 3 -4 times before you have to empty it out. We empty it out about 3 times a week.This easily goes from wood floor to carpet or rug very easily. It moves big things out of the way. Sometimes it takes a while but it can pretty much figure out how to get around things.There are a lot of more expensive ones out there that remember the walls and furniture in your room and do crazy stuff but for the price, this thing is worth it.The remote lets you drive it around, auto vacuum, and send it back home. There's an app that lets you do the same thing as the remote but you can also tell it to start or go back home from where ever you are. The set up to get it connected to your wifi is super easy.My rabbits use to be scared of this but now they follow it around or just lay and watch it. Sometimes it bumps into the and they know its just gonna turn around and go awayOne thing I didn't like which has only happened a couple of times is when the power goes in and out, the vacuum just starts going for a few minutes then goes back home.Eventually, I might go and grab Ecovacs newer models that do a few more things and do a review on that. but until then, my family love the ones that we have.

My first one dies when it was 14 months old - mind you we were lucky to run this twice a week It decided it was not going to take / hold a charge.  EcoVacs customer service told me I was out of luck AND they did not even have a repair service at that time but one would be available soon.  I placed in in the closet and ordered another unit thinking we'd give the old one to a family member after EcoVacs got their repair going.  The second one is not approximately 10 months old and the unit will not charge at the dock - I can plug it in and it charges fine.  EcoVacs solution is for me to PURCHASE a new dock despite being within my warranty period.  Not a good solution and I won't be purchasing a dock.On the third unit - I bought for my mother-in-law.  She used it a lot but bottom line was it lasted long enough for the warranty to expire and was dead.Ecovacs repair was expensive - over charged for repairs and shipping - almost the price of new.

"84,""The Good:-the basic cleaning and suction functions are good-it is not that noisy when running-pics up a lot of pet hairThe Bad:-terrible application- FIX THE SCHEDULING ISSUES!!!!!!! The app should ALWAYS override any other setting on the actual vacuum. Currently, I have 3 ghost vacuums waking me up in the middle of the night. Yes, I know the solution is to reset it but I'm quite annoyed by this being the 3rd time I do it. What caused the scheduling to unsync from the app? Power loss, phone reset, and mystery schedule that was overridden by the wrong timezone at some point.-THE BEEPS- If you make a """"dumb"""" vacuum, (random as you call it) designed for small spaces, WHY on earthy would you make it beep for 20 minutes if it get stuck!?! 3 loud beeps should be more than enough. I can't always go save its life every time it eats a show and it just ends up beeing for about half the morning because it simply won't shut up. This is perhaps the MOST annoying feature of this device. Even worse, this isn't customizable! It just beeps and beeps and beeps super loud for super long. FIX THIS.-Too dumb- the bump sensors are sometimes TOO sensitive and sometimes TOO aloof. Example- one of the biggest issues I have is a small tall shag carpet. Sometimes, It will detect the shag and move away- good ecovac. Other times, it will give 0 Fs and ram straight through the vacuum pushing the bump guard and continuing like a valiant soldier through a battlefield. Then, begins the issue with the beeping.-The remote- I like the remote, but it's stupid to have a remote a lot of users will misplace after a few months OVERRIDE the settings you've created on the app. Why is it so difficult to add a button to clear all the existing configs on the vacuum so that the APP settings are king on the ecovac?/endrantOverall, if just the beeping issue would be fixed I would not mind the other problems as much.

"114,""Overall a good vacuum for light maintenance work.  A full charge will give it about 1-1.5 hrs of vacuum at low suction.  There is a max suction option, but we don't use it much as it's a little louder and low suction still fills the bin.  We have 1 dog, who has a medium shed.  This vacuum does a nice job cleaning up the hair.  It runs every day and the bin is always full when complete, so it definitely works.  It works very well on hard wood floors.  You need to install their app to set a schedule.  Not happy with the fact that I needed to register with the manufacturer to use the app.  The vacuum does get hung up a lot on small objects, but that may be the case for all of these robotic vacuums.My biggest complaint is that the vacuum struggles to find it's way home.  There are way too many times when I have to go looking for it because it gets lost and just gives up.  Sort of like when you're out binge drinking with the guys and wake up on a park bench the next morning, but don't remember how you got there.  This is why I'm knocking a star off.

It does work on our bathroom tile floor, wood kitchen/hallway floor and the living room carpeting, but ... we have three open (no doors) points of entry in the living room so if I just want to vacuum in there I have to find something to block those points of entry.  It often gets stuck under one or two pieces of furniture so I have to find something to block those too.  It doesn't do well in corners and sometimes it has a difficult time finding its home base.  And it seems to keep going over the same area when in AUTO mode.  When I first got it, I experimented with setting the remote to have it automatically vacuum late at night.  Well now I can't get it to NOT run late at night.  I've contacted Ecovacs and they had me run a series of steps to """"reset"""" the unit (turn it off for 5 seconds, turn it back on, press the Auto button until it beeps three times, then remove the batteries from the remote and put them back in) which I tried several times.  Then a different tech had me remove the plug from the charger and plug it directly into the unit which I did for a night (no further instructions beyond that) and the next night I returned the plug to the charger.  Still runs by itself at night.  I had been corresponding back and forth with two different techs via email until I finally asked how they would proceed since their fixes haven't worked.  Now they are ghosting me.  I haven't heard anything from them and of course, we are way beyond the return window with Amazon, although I WAS within that window when all our corresponding began.

Then i had clean up the inside, and put everything back together.  This process takes over an hour. I used to be able to do it once every other month.  Then it became a month.  Last 2 weeks we have to take it apart everytime I use it.  All the time we spent on taking the whole thing apart and cleaning it, I might as well take out a broom and dustpan and just clean up the house myself."",""Reviewed in the United States on July 5, 2020""";;

"174,""It’s not terrible, but if you’re replacing a roomba on the cheap, as I was, you’ll probably be disappointed. Firstly, I don’t feel it covers as much ground as roomba does. When approaching a wall, instead of slowing down and lightly nudging the wall before heading off in a different direction, it pivots a few inches before the wall. It IS able to run alongside the wall and get the baseboard area, but it has to approach that position in a specific way.I also have trouble getting it to leave the room where the docking station is. The main level of my house has 5 rooms plus a small hallway, but it stays mostly in the office where the charger is plugged in. I sometimes have to create barriers to keep it from going back repeatedly.Lastly, it’s not great on carpet. It would probably do fine on very low pile like you would find in an office building, etc. but the one room I have that’s carpeted is pretty standard plush, and it doesn’t do the best job in there. My old roomba was great on any surface. I wish, in hindsight, that I’d just coughed up the extra hundred and bought a refurbished one.

It was good at cleaning up dirt and debris tracked in by our feet and our (small, nonshedding) dogs. But lately, the sensor for detecting obstructions is completely shot. It bangs into walls. It gets stuck under our couch (I’m not sure why it’s trying to push under the couch if the couch is too low). It can’t figure out how to get back to it’s charging dock before the battery runs out. I’ve even replaced the rechargeable battery once (which was also pretty expensive). Overall, I’m not very happy with this purchase. For as expensive as it is, it should work better for longer. It does a good job of “cleanup” with the debris still (when it is working), but it is no longer “convenient” when I have to go look for it every morning and—which usually involves lifting my couch and manually moving it to its charger.

I needed a specific repair part that looked like it should cost $10 max, but was advised that this part was not sold. We have owned Roombas in the past and there is huge availability of repair parts. On Deebot, parts availability is zilch and tech support is zero as well. If you consider this as a two-year disposable item, it's fine. As a longer-term vacuum solution, look elsewhere.Original review: We spend six weeks each year at a campground at the beach. Try as you might, it's impossible not to track in a bit of sand as you re-enter the camper from the beach. We found the Deebot N79S to be the perfect solution. We'll run the Deebot several times each day and it does an amazing job of removing sand from every nook and cranny of the camper.

"222,""Before I delve into the real reason for my 1 star rating (the product didn't last), I wanted to mention that one of the reasons I chose this model was that it was advertised to work with Amazon Alexa.  We never could get it working with her, and, as I recall, it had something to do with the type or speed of WiFi we have (some numbers I don't recall), so if that's a feature you're looking for on any type of robot vacuum, I suggest you carefully look into making sure it will be compatible with your specific type of WiFi.  We don't have any special kind of WiFi or Internet - just one of the standard choices from Comcast - so I was surprised.Now, for why I cannot recommend this specific robot vacuum: I understand it may seem strange to give 5 stars for all of the individual categories, but a 1 star overall.  The reason is that when it worked, it was great, but it only worked for about 14 months.  Then, inexplicably, it just stopped, and it was just 2 months after our 1-year warranty period had ended.  It would wander briefly away from the base, beep at us, flash red, and then we'd have to carry it back to the base even though it was fully charged.  As a family of 5, with 3 kids under the age of 7 when we purchased the robot vacuum, I really thought a machine like this would simplify my life, but didn't have the budget for the more reputable brand.  I throughly researched these items through customer reviews and consumer advocate magazines/websites, which lead me to choose this particular brand/item, so I was very disappointed when it proved to be unreliable.I did contact customer service to see if they would make an exception on the warranty, since it was so close to its expiration.  While they were great at sending us timely troubleshooting tips to see if we could figure out the problem, it ended up being something that would cost almost as much to repair as to purchase a whole new one and they would not cover it because the warranty period was over.  For an item at this price point, I wouldn't expect it to last forever, but definitely a few years.  It's also important to note that we were very careful that our children weren't rough with it - we did NOT put the baby on it for rides like you see in many funny home videos.Something more to consider: After it died, I thought I would really miss being able to push a button and relax as my floors were vacuumed, but I ended up with a popular brand of cordless, folding stick vacuum for the same price, which I now prefer.  I don't miss tripping over the vacuum and base on the floor (there are specific requirements for where you can put the base so your vacuum doesn't get """"lost""""/unable to find its way home, so it's not like you can just tuck it away in a corner).  My biggest messes would be around and under the dining table because my kids are very messy eaters (we must say """"hold over"""" 20 times per meal and there's still half their meal on their chair and floor and all over the table), and this type of vacuum was not great for that area because of all the chairs and table legs interfering with its path.  The stick vacuum I got also easily disassembles into a hand vac, so I can get under the table and chairs easily with the full stick vacuum and then detach the hand vac to quickly clean off the chairs themselves (and sometimes I even vacuum the table before wiping it down).Another issue that might vary among brands and models is that after we lost power once in a storm, we discovered that when the power came back on, the robot would start itself back up and immediately start vacuuming.  We discovered this one night when we were being awakened by a beeping sound in the middle of the night because we have very high marble transitions that it sometimes got stuck on - thankfully that was the only issue created by the self-starting.  But, if you're like me and your floors aren't always """"picked up"""" and free from miscellaneous children's toys or clothing (a sock here, a forgotten Barbie there), this could've been an even bigger problem when it turned itself on.  We don't currently have a pet, but we've also seen horror stories of pets that have had an accident on the floor & then the vacuum has spread (or flung) it all over the house - this could very well happen if the power flickered off and on in the night or while no one was home.  We learned we had to unplug it whenever we went away for the weekend or at night whenever there were storms in the forecast, which was kind of a pain.So, before you jump into the robot vacuum cleaner game, really think about what would truly work best for you and your family and whether a robot vacuum really is as convenient as it seems in the long run."",""Reviewed in the United States on June 17, 2020""";;

Note, we had an issue with the battery after maybe a year and a half, but it was easy to replace and only cost about $20.Pros:- we vacuum twice a week and the dustbin is pretty full every time, so it definitely works.- we have one cat and it does a good job cleaning the hair from hardwood. We don’t let kitty go into the bedroom, which has carpet, so not sure how Deebot would fare there.- pretty quiet, though I wouldn’t watch TV with it on.- hasn’t had any major issue.- the “edge” setting works well for cleaning up debris that collects where the wall meets the floor, especially in the kitchen.Cons:- tends to get stuck where the floor isn’t smooth. For example, I’ve realized it has a hard time going over the divider between the living room and kitchen so it tends to vacuum the kitchen less. This means we sometimes have to manually place it in the kitchen to give it a good clean.- the replacement side brushes we’ve purchased have all been of pretty low quality (sheds, gets tangled, etc.)."",""Reviewed in the United States on June 14, 2020""";;

It has such good suction that it cant help it.  It also is a """"little"""" bit of a pain to empty. But it does SO much better, I'm willing to forgive.We had to replace our 1st Deebot due to some serious use - their customer service was nothing but great and easily sent us a NEW replacement. And our original had been a Warehouse item. Yes, the Roomba has broken a few times now (including it's charging base) and it's not as durable as you would think for the price. And they were a PAIN to get help with when it broke.The app allows for SO much more flexibility in scheduling cleaning times. Roomba is once a day, and that's it. No good if you have three indoor pets and tons of floor traffic.The Roomba cost more. The replacement parts cost more. The Roomba is much louder. And the talking errors? After a few years, you get absolutely sick of listening to it. """"Please charge Roomba"""" """"Error. Please charge Roomba"""". when it, again, could not find it's way home or when it's sitting on the dang charger! ugh.The Roomba does a LOUSY job of finding it's way home. We rarely have to find the Deebot. Every other day I am locating the Roomba and placing it on it's charger. I'm about done with it.The Deebot also vacuums MUCH longer and seems to pick up more.My FAVORITE feature on the Deebot is that it will reset itself on it's charger (and continue charging) if my dog accidentally bumps it off. It takes me a day or so to figure out the Roomba was accidentally moved, is not charged and won't be for hours. It has to be *just* right on the charger or no charge.I wanted to get the fancy expensive Roomba with the little trash bin, but the performance of this one totally killed that idea.

"265,""This vacuum was great while it worked.First the good - It did a great job getting into all nooks and crannies of the living room. It was effective on multiple surfaces (hardwood floor and a few rugs of different height).  The scheduling and smart home integration is also a great feature - being able to schedule it to run daily and turn it on/off with voice commands is very convenient.  The battery lasts long enough to thoroughly clean the ~800 sq ft of our second floor.Unfortunately, the Deebot has now malfunctioned and refuses to work.  I get a 'side brush malfunction' error and no amount of cleaning resolves it. Reading through the reviews, it seems like this is a pretty common error with no easy resolution. Also, because it stopped working just ONE WEEK outside of the warranty period, my only option is to spend more money to send it off for repairs and hope the repair cost is less than the cost of a new Deebot.The features and operation are great, but unfortunately I can't recommend buying this product as it just doesn't seem like Ecovacs' build quality is that great."",""Reviewed in the United States on June 2, 2020""";;

"268,""I will say, I LOVED this vacuum for the first 3 months. It’s nothing fancy, but it works great. We have a cat, and hard flooring, so hair balls would tend to collect between cleanings. It was great having DEEBOT to do a run every other day or so and just keep on top of the pet hair.  Only real downside to note is this model does not have any machine learning capabilities. Meaning it will not ‘learn’ your home and know if it’s missed any spots. Essentially it just bounces from wall to wall in a random pattern over and over and hopes it gets it all. Sounds annoying but didn’t bother us at all. Comes with a remote control so you can direct it to a specific spot if need be. Another feature I liked was that the filter was washable. It was very easy to keep the bin and wheels cleanIt transitioned from our hard flooring to our area rug fine enough, but would sometimes struggle on our low pile area rug.Vacuum stopped working completely after 3 months use. Right in the middle of Covid. It is now June and we are looking into trouble shooting/ repair options.According to the manual, the beeps and flashing we are getting are because the bin and wheels need to be cleaned. As you can see from my picture, they are immaculate. But it still won’t turn on and work.Amazon just connects you with manufacture’s service team, which was a pretty frustrating experience. They have a terrible phone connection and the call kept cutting in and out. I was told they would send an email with troubleshooting options, but they have not.I’m really disappointed in this product. I would have rather gotten a robotic vacuum from Costco and been protected by their year return policy.  Most vacuum repair shops we’ve reached out to don’t service robotic vacuums. We’re now out $200, at a time we really can’t afford to replace it.

I live in a one-level apartment with hard-wood floors and throw-rugs.  What I like about the Deebot:  It cleans under furniture so you don’t have to move heavy items.  If I deebot-proof a single room like my bedroom or bathroom, I can just shut the door and let it do the job and leave it alone.  It does a pretty thorough job and leaves the floor shiny if you run it long enough.  It doesn’t have the same power as a regular vacuum so it needs to go over the same spot a few times.  What I don’t like:  after the warranty ran out, it began failing.  It runs for about 3 minutes and then starts beeping with an error.  The error is described in the manual as a sensor error and it says to clean the sensor but cleaning it doesn’t help.  I bought all new brushes and rollers and filters for it, it worked great for 1 day and then started w the beeping again.  Things to consider if you purchase:  you need to make sure that there are no electrical cords lying on the floor because you may walk into the room and find the deebot dragging your lamp around by the cord.  I put my cords in a shoe box because the deebot just thinks the shoebox is furniture.  You could buy this with the intention of replacing it in a year, the price was $139 when I purchased mine so maybe it was worth it.  However, I’m going to try to find a better one.  Does not clean (Carpets) as well as my Dyson, as nothing really does, but it does a good job for the minimal effort.

"292,""Roomba vs Ecovacs robot vacuum = no contest.We got an Ecovacs about 1.5yrs ago. I didn’t want to spend the money on a Roomba brand vac but wanted to give the robot thing a try. For a while we loved our E-vac (we named her DeeDee, the Dbot and spoke fondly to her by name)... but then she started making a horrible noise. All troubleshooting was a failure so the company sent us a new one. (Excellent customer service I will say!) Sadly a few months later a different and even louder noise started happening. Not wanting to ask for a second replacement...Husband decided to order a Roomba when he saw one on sale. We have only had it a week, so longevity is still to be determined - but cleaning power, ability to NOT get stuck on certain things, and ease of setting it up on a schedule = all so much easier and better with the Roomba.We have 2 dogs that shed like crazy and another dog who chews up toys like crazy and little bits are often found on the ground - Roomie (her name now) is doing a great job getting it all up!  She’s a little louder than DeeDee was before her issues... but I attribute that to being stronger and sucking better. <U+0001F642>So, if you are in the market - I say just go for the more expensive one. She sucks, very well!"",""Reviewed in the United States on May 27, 2020""";;

"367,""I love this Deebot! I have the N75SE which is the exact same thing as the N79S, only difference is the N79S is sold on Amazon and the N79SE is sold at Best Buy. Even though I did not buy my robot on amazon I always count on the reviews when buying a product.For the price point this thing has surpassed all my expectations. I have two cats as well as my roommate. I run my N79SE every night and the bin is always full. Now I see some reviews saying it cannot navigate around their home properly or cannot ever find it's way to the kitchen or the bathroom. Well do the research before buying, it navigates completely at random despite the bumpers and IR sensors. It has no cameras nor a laser so it cannot navigate like the higher end models. Also someone commented that the model in their manual said N79S and the robot says DN622.11, it's the same thing DN622.11 is the model that's used world wide.Pros: has great suction for the price. Runs for a good amount of time before needing recharged. I get about 1 hour on carpet. Run time depends on the surface its ran on. Longer on smoother floors. It automatically returns to its charging base before the battery dies completely. Super easy to clean. Love that it has four ways to turn it on, app, alexa/google, remote, button on robot. Great that you can navigate using a remote or app like it's an rc car which comes in handy. Also super quiet.Cons:Does take a long time to charge in my opinion. About 4 hours. I have a ledge that goes from carpet to laminate and when the sun is reflecting off of it near the ledge it seems to go over it probably 3 out of every 10 times I run it in those lighting conditions which is evening since the windows face west. Morning midday and night I dont have the issue. Since it does navigate randomly it doesnt always get where I want it to unless I use the remote to put it there and spot clean or put up a barrier. Lastly this is the first robot I've owned so I'm not sure if comparable ones are the same but it has issues getting onto the base. Some other brands are more flat so it can just slide on. This one has a nodule for the front wheel so it cant always get on it right away. Sometimes it does it the first try, sometimes it takes 2-3 minutes, and sometimes it knocks the base over or gets stuck on it but that hardly happens and usually only acts like a drunk sailor for a minute or two then I hear the beeps that it made it. Also if you set a time schedule to start automatically I reccomend the app to be used for it. The remote will do it but only goes in 15 minute increments unlike the app and if you do set the schedule time on the remote even though once you're done and hear the robots beep confirmation always make sure the remote is in range of the robot when the time comes otherwise it will not start. But overall for the price I'm very happy. It makes a great starter robot. I would not buy this one expecting it to work just like the high end types of another brand as other some reviewers have indicated how disappointed they were when it didnt do what they thought it can do but in fact did exactly how it was made to do."",""Reviewed in the United States on May 1, 2020""";;

All of our floors are hardwood or ceramic tile but we do have some throw rugs in places and this little guy climbs right over them and off the other side and does a fine job cleaning them.

Over time we started to notice that Donald would not always avoid colliding with objects as it moved around the house. We began to see a pattern. When doing edge cleaning that it would use the bump into the wall when running in a clockwise direction, but it would avoid the wall in the anticlockwise direction. As time has passed, the collisions have increased, and after doing some research, the issue is that the front lens gets dirty and scratched, preventing the sensors from detecting the wall. I decided to service the front bumper, and to my surprise, I discovered that the left side sensor array is completely missing from Donald.

"372,""I took my time analyzing Deebot before writing a review. Sorry for the delay. —- After reading some review, I was a little skeptical, since I am an international buyer. But since I got coverage for 3 years, I decided to buy it. Because who gives a protection plan for 3 years if the product wasn’t going to make it. I do not regret it. Some people complaint that it makes some noise. Well, it never said it was noiseless. According to me, that noise is normal, acceptable and necessary for you to know Deebot is coming. Does it get stuck? Yes, sometimes. It depends on what you have in your house. I have a carpet, handmade with long strings, logically it will pick all the strings until getting stuck. I have a standing lamp, which it will climb on the base, but after that will loose control of the wheels and will stay hanging like a turtle on the lamp. Do I still have to help Deebot. Yes. Of course, Is a robot. Thank God. Now that I know the dangers in my house, I took care of those to protect my Deebot. I am happy, cleans hard floors perfectly, house is always clean. I use the app to see if everything is under control with Deebot ..... and I get to relax, watch television, drink coffee and have my house clean up."",""Reviewed in the United States on April 30, 2020""";;

"379,""Within a couple months my Deebot started emitting a 4-beep error message. Some research suggested the brushes needed cleaning so while I periodically cleaned them anyway I just replaced every brush and filter on it since they're fairly cheap. This temporarily resolved the issue.Within weeks the error messages returned and a subsequent replacement of brushes did not resolve the issue. The Deebot would run for maybe 2 minutes, stop, and emit an error message. I'd push the button and it would again run for a couple minutes and stop again. I became a slave to this thing.Shortly there after the robot stopped working all together. On the dock the light would pulse blue then go out. Even though this thing had been run for only a few months I replaced the battery since I know these Lithium batteries can go bad and they have a cycle life anyway. That didn't fix the problem. Deebot is still dead. By the way, it is a plug in battery not the kind with clips so don't direct me to that video where they bend the clips to improve battery contact.When this thing was working it wasn't really working all that great and I have hard floors.

"381,""I’ll start off by saying we had been loving our handy little cleaning friend for about a year. We ran it each evening as a nice clean up from the day. Even with 2 dogs and a cat (all short haired), it did a great job of leaving the hard floors clean looking for the next morning. We were regularly impressed with how much dust/hair we emptied out and frequently cleaned all filters, brushes, etc. to keep it in tip-top shape. Then one evening it beeped at us and stopped running. Using the app, we found an error for a “side brush malfunction”. After attempting to fix it for half an hour, my husband gave up and we went to bed. The next night, we tried to run the vacuum again and yay, it worked! For about an hour. Before stopping, beeping and giving us the same side brush error. Well, our luck only lasted one night as it coming on again was apparently a one-time fluke. It will no longer run so long as there is a “side brush malfunction”. My husband did research on it and found this is a regular problem with the vacuum and the solution is a new motor, which costs about $40. So knowing it had a one year warranty, I got on to check my purchase date for a replacement and of course- it was about 2 weeks past our one year warranty. Save the hassle and spend a little bit more to get a good name brand- all of my friends and family who have the more name brand robot vacuums have had theirs for 2-3+ years with no problems at all.

"386,""In my view this has been a very good robot vacuum for the price.  Even though it's a """"dumb"""" vacuum with just a bump sensor and no camera or position tracking, it does a remarkably good job of covering an entire area.  It seems to work well for about 700 sq ft at a time, so I need to run it twice in zones in order to get the whole house.  Its suction is by no means a deep clean or a complete substitute for a normal vacuum, but rather than vacuuming manually every couple weeks I only need to do it every few months, so this has saved me a lot of time while still keeping the cat hair under control.The biggest downside for me is the battery life has never been the full 120 minutes that was advertised.  It started out at about 90 and dropped throughout the year to below 60.  I eventually had to buy a new battery.  It does tend to get stuck a lot - under couches, on lamp bases, other random places - so you have to prepare the area before vacuuming to remove everything it tends to get stuck on.I would still recommend this vacuum as a quality choice for someone who wants to try out a robovac."",""Reviewed in the United States on April 26, 2020""";;

So, after several days of incorporating ALL of the reset and troubleshooting advice I received from the customer service representatives, I finally got the Ecovac connected to the phone app. The Ecovac worked great and I had no issues with it, except that I wasn't able to schedule daily cleanings.

I have had to use it twice to give the Deebot 20/20 vision again. After a period of time, it begins to bump into things and when this does it's because the windshield has become dirty or foggy and it is not seeing clearly, use the headlight cleaner and it runs like new, not bumping into items.

"449,""TLDR";"Great for the first two months. Replaced on month three. Wifi doesn't work after six months.Here's the full review:I purchased this from the Amazon Treasure Truck when it was on special last year. It was a great price and my first 'robot vacuum'. It worked amazing. No problems at all. We had it set to a schedule, so it would start cleaning about ten minutes after we left. Once a week, it would lodge itself under the fridge door, or get stuck on the trim between rooms. Not a huge deal. It beeps a few times when it happens, then it shuts off.Two months: We came home one day, and it was stopped in the kitchen. I did my normal trying to turn it on and send it home. It just beeped, then shut off. I searched online to fix it, but even after a factory reset(or at least the steps I read about) it wouldn't work again. I tried leaving it on the charger overnight. I finally reached out to Ecovacs after a few days of trying things. They sent me a replacement and I sent the old one in. Great customer service.Six months: The replacement was working fine for four months or so. I even swapped out all the brushes and filters. One day in late January I realized it was showing the vacuum as offline in the app. The schedule worked, so it wasn't a huge deal. I tried a few things, then reached out to Ecovacs again. After wiping the vacuum, it no longer has my schedule. It is strictly manual use only now. I've done 10 different sets of instructions, including wiping and setting up my router all over again, trying a different router, and a wide variety of other """"solutions"""". Nothing worked. It's been a manual only vacuum for three months now, and I've been emailing Ecovacs a few times a week to see if I can get a replacement. I'll update if it ever comes. Many people online have said the wifi quits working on this model after a short time and that it's due to a faulty wifi module."",""Reviewed in the United States on April 5, 2020""";

"460,""I did my research.  I learned that the Deetbot was the best robo vacuum for your money. It is amazing!  We have a long haired weenie dog and two cats. I have a Shark pet vacuum, which is great, but I am not the best housewife. We have vinyl plank flooring and big  area rugs. Large dust bunnies lurk in my corners.In an effort to slay the dust bunnies, I bought this vacuum. When you take him out of the box, you need to fully charge him on his base. It took ours about 5 hours. He has several cleaning options: auto clean, single room clean, spot cleaning, and edging.We decided to first do a deep single room clean for all of our rooms.  We let him clean the living room first. The living room has a pet door, so it is a high traffic area. Deetbot can run up to approximately 2 hours without stopping.  We let him clean the room for the entire time. I did pause him to check the dustbin, because I was curious.  It packs the debris so tightly that it is able to suck up a large load.  I was amazed with how much it picked up!  You may want to pause him (via the remote) and dump it a few times just so it has more space in the bin.When Deetbot is finished, he returns to his home base to recharge.  You will want to dump the dust bin after each use. Deetbot comes with a filter that you can wash by hand. We did our whole house without having to wash the filter. I did wash it at the end just to test it.  It is a fine plastic mesh.  I ran it under hot water, dried it, and put it back in the Deetbot.Since we had so much pet hair, we let it deep clean single rooms twice.  Wow! So much pet hair and dirt. My floors and rugs are really clean!  I can feel the difference when I walk on the floor and the rugs.Deetbot’s sensors learn your room and remembers obstacles so it doesn’t keep running into chair legs, coffee tables, etc.  It forgets when you turn it turn it off or charge it, so if you move furniture it isn’t a problem. It just learns the room again.  He can go under anything that is 3 inches high, so he gets all the grossness under your sofa, chairs, and bed.Deetbot easily climbs on top of rugs and doesn’t get stuck. If you have a rug with raggedy decorative edges, it might try to suck them up.  I would take those rugs up or tuck the edges under the rug.Deetbot cleans using an algorithm.  He does not run in a straight path when cleaning on auto or single room mode. However, he uses the algorithm to clean every spot in the room.When you use the edger cleaning, he does make a straight line around your room.  He is able to move around obstacles to move back to the edges.  He knows which areas he couldn’t get because of the obstacles, and makes a valiant effort to maneuver behind or beside the obstacles to clean the edges.In spot cleaning mode, Deetbot makes a 3 minute growing spiral path in the area you need cleaning (like in a high traffic area or if you spilled catnip).He comes with a remote that allows you to choose the function you want. Once you push the button, he is raring to go!  You can set multiple cleaning times with the remote, so if you want him to clean every night at 2 am, he will do it!  The only down side is that if you turn him off, you have to reprogram him again (not a big deal, it is really simple).Deetbot is very quiet. My pets were initially skeptical of Deetbot, but they quickly learned he was not a threat. Now they ignore him.  If he comes near your pet, Deetbot will see him as an obstacle and go another way. My dad’s cat likes to stalk Deetbot for sport, and is disappointed when Deetbot maneuvers around him.Deetbot comes with an app you can use, but it is complicated and unnecessary. Deetbot’s remote control is sufficient.I used it in my elderly parents house, who have four cats.  My mom says Deetbot vacuums better than her biweekly maid (who happens to LOVE vacuuming).I love this robot. My friend has a Roomba, but I think Deetbot does a much better job.

It sucks up grass and stuff from being tracked inside, kitty litter that the kitty’s kick past the litter mat, cat hair, dog hair, and normal things a traditional vacuum can get up. Long hair gets stuck and tangled badly in the bristles. Kudos for putting in a tool to cut the hair but it doesn’t work that well at grabbing the hair off the roller.

I have (a lot of) pets... 2 dogs and 4 cats... and running this vacuum daily keeps my house clean! I still run my hand vacuum every few weeks on my carpets since I do have 6 pets, but for the price this vacuum certainly gets the job done!There was a short period of time where Deebot would run for 1 minute and then stop and begin beeping. This went on for days and I was lost without my Deebot. I googled videos on how to fix and it turned out to be very simple! I had been emptying the tray daily and cleaning the filter weekly, but I hadn’t unscrewed the bottom to take the brush out to really clean it (aside from pulling some hairs out while it was still in tact). This did the trick and he’s back to his normal cleaning.I enjoy the multiple functions of this vacuum, though I typically just set him on auto. There’s also a spot clean function and perimeter clean.The only downfall to this vacuum is that it’s not a wet vac, but you know that going into the purchase and mopping the floor is not a big deal when you’re home is vacuumed daily by Deebot. Also, he occasionally gets stuck on items left on the floor, but that shouldn’t deter you from buying this vacuum since every other robot vacuum I assure you will do the same thing.I highly recommend this robot vacuum and have even bought one as a gift for my brother who also loves it too.

After 6 months of normal use,  I started receiving several errors, like """"anti-drop sensor malfunction"""" and """"side brush malfunction.""""  Replacing side brushes did nothing to clear that error.  Sometimes I could do a quick wipe down of the exterior of the vacuum and that would clear the errors.  Other times, I had to fully dismantle every screw and pull apart the motherboard to get into the wheel wells to get this thing clean.  I'm an electronics technician, I'm pretty sure that type of cleaning is behind the expertise of the normal user.Eventually, cleaning the vacuum stopped working and the errors wouldn't clear.  I contacted Ecovacs who sent us a """"new"""" replacement vacuum.  The second vacuum started giving errors almost immediately.  After about 3 months it stopped working completely.  This time, a diode inside the vacuum started leaking and caused discoloration on the lens of one of the anti-drop sensors.  The sensor can't see, therefore the vacuum won't run.  I contacted customer support, who informed me that since I'm outside of the one-year warranty period of the original vacuum, they'll do nothing to help.Let me be clear: they gave me a """"new"""" vacuum that lasted just long enough to put me past the warranty period of the first vacuum.

Dust everywhere, hairballs, my carpet changed color, uggh.Admittedly, I did not get this from Amazon, but from a box chain store on a whim. Dear god, I love this thing. It has made vacuuming a thing of the past. Fortunately I have a relatively small home and that was all hard surfaces downstairs, so this thing does great. I do from time to time have to deburr the brush (FYI, if the thing keeps beeping with the red light and you can't figure out the issue, pull the roller and clean it. It senses an overload in the motor and shuts down to protect itself)Only the biggest items cause it issues, but it will give it a damn good try before tapping out and loudly beeping for help. Likes to eat toilet paper too.In simplest terms, if you want something simple, effective, and aren't expecting HAL-level intelligence for this price, this thing will work and you will be very satisfied."",""Reviewed in the United States on February 12, 2020""";;

"639,""After debating for a year, we finally purchased the Deebot N79S last year.  It quickly became one of our favorite devices. Since owning the machine, we purchased replacement parts and monitored the performance on the app and emptied the canister at least once or twice per rotation and did a thorough cleaning of the brushes and parts regularly.  We put in the effort to ensure its longevity, which is why we were disappointed when it stopped working recently, after just a few weeks over our year of ownership.  Amid rotation, it stopped and started beeping for no reason.  My husband googled troubleshooting videos and took it apart and cleaned everything thoroughly and it is still not working. It was a vital part of our everyday upkeep.I reached out to Ecovacs customer service and after having me try a few troubleshooting ideas, told me that I am out of warranty (by just a few weeks) and other than providing a number for a repair center. The warranty online says """"at least one year"""". I have referred a friend to this product and even purchased an additional Deebot to gift to my parents this year for Christmas because I was so thrilled with this product.

"640,""The vacuum is very good in terms of picking up large amounts of dog hair from 2 dogs who shed a lot all year. I live in a single story 2800 square foot house with all hardwood flooring (laminate in bathrooms and kitchen). This bot does a good job of picking up the dog hair. My problem is with the controls. Unit does not return to base when you select that option, does not stay in one room when you select that option. It seems to like to go to the same places over and over again, often the places where it always gets stuck which is super annoying. I can only use it if I’m home to get it out of trouble and redirect it to where it is needed instead of where it likes to go. Very random pattern. Also I have connected it to my iPhone and it shows as linked but controls often don’t work when I try to use the phone instead of the remote. I reached out to customer service and was told to take out batteries from remote and the unit and wait an hour and reset the unit. This did not help. Next were instructions that included taking the unit apart which would likely void the warranty after I failed so I did not do this and I am living with it as is. I was sent an email to review the customer service I got but when I went to give feedback it had “expired” and would not let me. I guess they don’t really care about how helpful their customer services is. It had not been that long since I got the email.

I was getting tired of all of the piles of dog hair along the baseboards of our 1600 sq. ft. tile and area rug home so I purchased this as a birthday present to myself. I am SO glad I did.Pros: Deebot is great at picking up dog hair and dust from the the hard floors. He's also great at picking up larger scraps and particles from the area rugs. I empty the bin after every run, and it is always half to completely full, every day.The battery lasts long enough to sweep about half of the house. I have it set to clean the common areas during our sleeping hours, and during the day I let it loose in the bedrooms. Those areas are separated by a mounted baby gate, so it works perfectly with our set up.It forces me to keep my house picked up. That doesn't come naturally. But knowing that it is going to come on every night is motivating. I don't want to be woken up to beeping because it ate something it shouldn't have.Cons: The timer is not too consistent. If I change the time I want it to come on, it doesn't register right away. I usually have to turn the vacuum off at the switch, take the batteries out of the remote, reinsert batteries and reset the time and timer. It is a pain.

I haven't tried too hard because the remote does all of the same things as the app, but it might be a problem for some.One other thing. One night a left a covered tumbler of water on the floor by the couch. When Deebot came on, he knocked over the tumbler and sucked up all of the water over the course of his shift. I woke up to Deebot sitting in a puddle. I resigned myself to the fact that I screwed up and would have to replace him, but decided to try to dry him out. I took out the brushes and dust bin and left him in the laundry room for 36 hours. When he seemed to have no more water seeping from his seams, I reassembled and started him up.

"712,""I am very sorry to say that I am very disappointed in this machine.  I have waited over a year to post this review hoping that I wouldn't have to put a negative mark on this item, but it is time.  This was purchased as a Christmas gift in 2018 from my mother.  It worked great out of the box, I was very happy.  But within 6 months I had to contact the company because it stopped working (Amazon couldn't help) and it would just spin around and around and finally shut off and beep.  I have had a Roomba so I knew that the sensor was more than likely stuck, or the brushes had a problem.  So I had done the problem resolving prior to contacting them.  Once they responded, which was fairly quick, we had some back and forth trouble shooting and they sent me a label to return the machine and send me an exchange.  They come with a 1 year warranty from purchase date.  That was #1......to be followed with the second exchange for the SAME thing within 4 months.  But wait, there is more......my warranty was apparently past and I had the exact same thing happen AGAIN....so here went Exchange #3 for the SAME THING......now at this point we are apparently way past the """"warranty timeframe"""" but no one EVER mentioned that to me.  I would have thought each machine would be a one year.  So fast forward to early December 2019 and the newest machine starts doing the SAME THING again....I contacted the company on the SAME email thread we have been using all this time and they sent me troubleshooting again.  I responded, politely, and told them that I had done that and this was not my first rodeo, this would be my FIFTH exchange on this robot.  They asked me for a video of what it was doing, naturally I had it all packed up and ready to ship out, but I did it.  They came back with more troubleshooting and I replied again that I had done all that.  So the last email I got from them was explaining that they only offer a ONE year warranty on the item and that was from the Original date of purchase.  Funny no one mentioned that with the last 3 exchanges that were definitely after the one year mark.  I consider myself lucky to have those extras, trust me, but in the end this machine was not made well.  No one should have that many exchanges on one machine in that short of a time.So, if you want something dependable, do NOT buy this one.  I have purchased a few others since then, and if they seem like they will be junk, they go back!  Amazon is the best about that."",""Reviewed in the United States on January 29, 2020""";;

I live in a ranch with wood floors, Berber carpet and a very plushy large rug. I run Catbot in the morning when everyone is getting ready because she bumps into things including bedroom doors so that’s not ideal for sleeping. If we were in a two story I wouldn’t have a problem running her at night. Also I didn’t think she would be able to get on my rug because it’s so thick but she always manages to. She does get the top layer of dirt off it but I’ll still have to go over it with the big vacuum every now and again. Problem is she gets stuck on it a lot. But I don’t really mind.

I quickly learned that it cannot transition from regular carpet to rugs (not even super plush). It also tended to trap itself on various objects, which kind of defeated the purpose of running it when I was not home. It came to the point where I had to be at home and monitoring/babysitting it in order it for it to be even moderately effectively. I accepted that fact and supplemented with regular vacuuming periodically. However, by December, it was completely nonfunctional and no longer works.

"730,""I bought this unit specifically for the Wi-Fi functionality, which has never worked, because my unit was defective upon arrival.Before I contacted the company about my unit's inability to connect to Wi-Fi, I did EXTENSIVE troubleshooting on my own. I'm a technology worker/QA tester by day, and on top of that—not a huge fan of returns/exchanges (takes away all the convenience of ordering a product online). Which is all to say that I exhaust all my options before asking for a replacement.In this case, thinking my unit's inability to connect to wi-fi was perhaps tied to my network and/or phone, I took the N79S to multiple locations to test on other networks—couldn't connect there, either.Among the other troubleshooting methods I tried to eliminate variables, following their support docs:- pairing with different phones—in case that was the problem.- I booted, rebooted and reset all involved devices- changed network names and passwords- deleted and reinstalled the companion app,- made sure I was testing on 2.4GHz networks onlyEventually, it was clear that the the internal wi-fi hardware was faulty, because in the ecovacs setup app, if the DEEBOT can't connect to the network, it is supposed to create it's own wi-fi network for a device to connect to. My unit was incapable of doing that (tested w/multiple devices).I contacted Ecovacs within my warranty period and explained all the troubleshooting I had done, and requested a simple exchange. They asked me to do a bit more troubleshooting I had already done, but I repeated it and sent a response.They asked for more troubleshooting I had already done, and information I had already given—such as what model I had, what country I lived in when I had already sent my proof of purchase, etc.All together, my detailed and simple request for an exchange turned into an 8 (!) email back and forth with different reps, where at one point I was asked what date and time(s) this issue had occurred, on top of being asked to repeat steps I had already done.This was my first Ecovacs purchase, and I have never experienced such poor customer service in my life. It was as though they wanted to stall/wear me out and avoid an exchange. They won, because I eventually gave up. When the vacuum doesn't connect, and I have already explained that I've tried and failed multiple times, being asked the date and time of specific failures is unnecessary.With any mass market product, there are bound to be some duds—I understand and respect that. But I always give a company the chance to make things right. Instead of helping me with the problem and turning my experience with the brand into a positive, Ecovacs made things much, much worse by giving me the runaround. By contrast—I have another robot vacuum by a competing brand (which I wont name because I'm not trying to promote them by tearing down Ecovacs) that developed a problem. One brief support request, and they sent me a replacement within 2 days, before receiving the defective unit back.Now I have an N79S that is basically a paperweight, and has given me more headaches and wasted more of my time than any one product should.My advice is to buy another option in hopes that that company stands behind their products and has competent customer service—otherwise you'll curse the day something goes wrong with your Ecovacs.In short: AVOID this company!"",""Reviewed in the United States on January 25, 2020""";;

It sweep under my furniture and beds etc. The next morning the floors still looked great but decided to run it again.  I couldn't believe it managed after 2 hours to fill itself up again. Clean up  of the Deebot is a breeze. Dump it, then rinse everything with warm water and let dry. It's also cool that it parks itself back in the charger when battery is low. The first night it did start working in the middle of the night but that was an easy fix after reading instructions.  You just hold the right button down for 3 seconds and turn off timer mode. I did one room at a time in my testing of it to find trouble spots before I turned it loose on the entire house at one time. FYI,  it will eat a phone cord and if it can get to your surround sound speaker wires it has enough power to pull them all down, it also cant digest dryer sheets but it will try haha.

I followed the Ecovacs basic troubleshooting of removing the battery, plugging the unit in directly to the adapter instead of using the base--just as I did with the original unit. The company said that because it was a year past the original purchase date, even though they have record of the replacement in July, they will not do more than send me a new battery.

It got wedged up int he wheel and tiremarks of dog poop tracked throughout the room. It took at least a full day to sanitize and clean up after the incident. The manufacturers should be aware of this happening as should any potential buyers. I never run the vacuum without being around to stop such catastrophes from happening. That nightmare out of the way: It is a bit loud, it is a vacuum after all. It is hard to watch tv or listen to music/podcasts in the same room as it works in. It fills up very quickly and you'll probably have to dump it almost every time you use it. It gets stuck very easily on bathroom rugs, behind furniture, and anywhere with higher carpet. It reliably gets stuck on one particular spot in my house almost every time I use it. Anything you leave in the floor will be sucked into it. It's taken a few computer cords along with it for a little ride until I pull them out. Today I ran it and it took an empty bag of dog food into another room and knocked the fireplace log holder on it's side. It bumps into things and makes very loud noises when it does yet somehow, the sensors on it have always kept it from falling down the stairs. I wonder if the programmers could program it a little better so it could slow down and not make such loud bangs. I think this technology is amazing and can make your life easier.

"928,""This unit is excellent! I love being able to see its’ status and control it from work. I also really enjoy being able to control it with voice commands from Google Home. We had a Eufy before the Deebot N79 and it got stuck a lot more.  It seems the Deebot is a lot less “risky” in maneuvering, but will still eventually get all walls and corners. I prefer it this way because coming home to a stuck unit gets old really quickly.  It also does a better job of finding it’s way back to the charger.  The Eufy unit seemed to die quite often, even if it didn’t get stuck. I’ve had for over a year and everything is holding up nicely, including the battery.  We also have steps and the sensors haven’t failed to stop it from falling.  I have heard of this happening to some people’s units in the reviews, but the cause seems to be that the sensor is covered with dust. So, as long as it’s swiped clean every once in a while, it should be fine. I’ve enjoyed using it so much that I bought one for my parents this year....and recommended it to many friends. When this eventually dies, I’ll definitely be buying another."",""Reviewed in the United States on January 2, 2020""";;

"950,""I've had this vacuum about 6 months and I *mostly* love it!  I can let it run and it picks up so much crud I never even realized was on my floors. Sometimes it's done cleaning before the battery runs out, but other times it seems like it has more to do when the battery runs out.  The drawbacks are: it gets hung up on cords and thick carpet, which kills the battery so I feel like have to be home when I run it. Also, it fills up fairly quickly and sometimes overflows the contents onto the floor. Recently, one of the spinner brushes has started making a loud clicking sound that I can't seem to fix (one of the brushes spins more loosely than the other, but it doesn't seem obviously fixable), which is quite annoying to listen to. This vacuum won't get all the dust balls in hard to reach places, so you'll still need to vacuum baseboards that the robot cannot access. I haven't set it up to map my house yet, but that feature seems like it would make mapping more efficient. Overall, I am quite happy about my investment because this truly saves me a lot of time as I need to vacuum almost daily since I have a dog and a cat!"",""Reviewed in the United States on December 31, 2019""";;

"953,"" I am writing this update after multiple defective units.  As you can see from the attached video the unit makes a noise from the right side brush.  1st replacement was in December, 2nd replacement was in January. This is the 3rd unit with the exact same issue.  When I requested a refund from the company I was told they would look into it and get back to me. After a week, I contacted them and they said they would only replace the unit. I told them I didn't want a replacement as this was the 3rd unit with the exact same issue. After a few emails back and forth I was told to return it through Amazon.  I informed them I couldn't as it had been over 30days and couldn't return.  I was then offered a 15% off coupon as compensation. I told them I didn't want the coupon as I had no faith in their products.  Even though the unit has a 1 year warranty, they did not want to refund my money. Their last offer was a """"free unit"""", but if the same issue keeps happening, when the year is up I will be left with a broken unit and no replacement.  I know this was a long read but my hope is that with will help some one who is thinking of buying this product.  I definitely do not recommend this vac.!Previous Review:It is a great little robot. I like that you can start it by telling Alexa to start cleaning. Picks up dog hair easily.  Mind you we have a small short hair Chihuahua. We did have an issue with the 1st robot. After a few weeks one of the side brushes started making a clicking noise.  I contacted the company and after a few emails I sent them my defective robot.  About a week later I had my new robot.

"964,""I'm giving the Ecovacs Deebot N79S 2 stars because this vacuum was great when it worked but the infrared sensors have now failed on 2 separate vacuums.  When the infrared sensors are working properly the vacuum will recognize walls and will slow down before making contact.  However, when the infrared sensors fail the vacuum no longer recognizes walls or doors and runs into them full speed.  The vacuum moves fast enough and hits the door hard enough that if it hits our bedroom door it will wake us up at night.The infrared sensors stopped working on our original purchase while the vacuum was still within the 1 year warranty and Ecovacs replaced the vacuum.  The infrared sensors on the replacement vacuum just failed the other day, exactly 1 month after the 1 year warranty expired so Ecovacs will no longer replace it.  Different vacuum, same exact problem.If you want to spend a few hundred dollars to have a vacuum that works for 6 months to a year then this is the one for you.
