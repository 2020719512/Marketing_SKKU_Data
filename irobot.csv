  Great for touch ups but not the same deep cleaning of a conventional vacuum. Does need babysitting, it often gets stuck under chairs and under furniture.

  For the most part I love my Roomba! She works great! The only part I don¡¯t like is she gets stuck in the weirdest ways. I used to have the couch up against a wall with an area rug in front of it and the Roomba would get stuck underneath the couch. Also I had a small step down (2.5¡±) and it wouldn¡¯t sense the step so it would fall down and get stuck down there. Other than that I really like my Roomba.

  We had another brand robot vacuum from some Chinese knockoff that was cheaper and worked better.  Extremely disappointed.My complaints for hard surface:- instead of sucking up dust, it usually shoots it out in front.- literally goes right over small debris sometimes and doesn¡¯t pick it up.- supposed to self dock and charge but doesn¡¯t. Literally stops somewhere in the same room as the dock and receive verbal instructions from the roomba to dock it. Seriously?- suction seems very weak.- vacuum pathing is soooo random and all over the place that it takes forever to clean a room, IF it even stays in the same room. Usually leaves the room long before it can go over even half the room.Sooo disappointed. I thought getting this name brand vacuum would be a good experience. I even check out video reviews but just can¡¯t believe this is the same thing that received top reviews.Seriously thinking to give this to a friend and buying something else. What a waste of money.

  I had a house cleaner, every 2 weeks <U+2014>- but with three dogs, I really need to vacuum every day. Now, I schedule my Roomba, and it makes all the difference. Yes, it misses a few places... But it can also get all the way under the beds, and some other places that I could never reach. I love this little robot, even named her Hazel!

  I've only used on hard (bamboo) floors, so not sure how well it would work on carpet.  This is such a time saver for me.  I have 2 dogs, one cat, and three young kids so our floors get plenty dirty.  I programmed it run at night when we are in bed.  It makes a fair amount of noise, but it doesn't bother us because I use it on the lower level and we sleep on the second floor.  I empty the dustbin every morning and it's usually pretty full.  The only annoying thing is that it gets stuck on our rubber floor mat.  It goes over a different one easily as it is thinner.  I pick up the thicker mat and the rag rug I have, along with our kitchen stools every evening so it can do a thorough job.  Strangely, it hadn't gotten stuck on the Christmas tree skirt at all yet.  I'll also add that we have a sunken livingroom so there's a step down and it has never fallen off the edge.

  I love Roomba but this model is useless for pet hair UNLESS you're ok with taking the brushes out after every clean and ripping the hair out of the brushes. We have a white siberian husky and a Samoyed - this roller type just can't handle it. They have a model with rubber rollers which is significantly better and doesn't require you having to clean the rollers.

  This type of vacumn did not work for me. My house is an avg size Ranch house,but my rooms are smaller. I have too much stuff sitting on the floor like plants or wastebaskets. You have to have a clear space with electric cords not hanging down from sockets. It kept going into corners&getting stuck&sat spinning. It also was not the newest model&did not work with my new 5G network. You need to check details closely. It also does not hold much waste,so it has to be used more times per week to get everything.

  Purchased this to replace a knock-off brand that I also bought off Amazon 13 months ago (it died on schedule, 1 month after the warranty!). The quality of this device with regard to the ability to pick up debris and pet hair is amazing. It does a great job. Running it daily, the bin in full each day.The problem is, it can't automate for the (lack of) life of itself. Each day, it's gotten stuck, gotten lost and battery died while trying to find the dock. (Perspective - It's in a 1-bedroom apartment - hard to get lost and the dock is in the dead center of a an open, minimally furnished den)Even when I'm home and tell it to dock (because it gets so lost the batter is too low to accept commands from Alexa), I have to hand guide it across the apartment step by step stopping it from going away from the dock.Will be returning this one. If you're looking for automation, don't waste your money.

  Good for what it does. I have 2 large dogs, a husky and a rottweiler, and it is able to clean up their hair without issue. I have tile and carpet in my house and it can clean both well.Few things about this when purchasing one, you will need to empty it often. Don't let it build up. Also make sure to clean the underneath out if there's any hair stuck in it.and also wires. this thing will suck up wires and keep going with it as long as it can. Make sure to clean up your cable/wire management when getting one of these.Other than that, I greatly appreciate this device. Works well, and will dock itself back into the charger at the end of its shift.

  I took time out of my day to write this review and I want everyone reading this to understand I am saying this with my entire chest: do not buy this vacuum. I¡¯ve owned one other automatic vacuum from a different brand (DeeBot) that was SO much better and less expensive. Ive been using my iRobot for about 8 months and it causes me daily frustration. It never works how it¡¯s supposed to. Sometimes it stops for no reason as if it¡¯s stuck on something and tells me I need to clean the brushes, but there is nothing stuck in them. It doesn¡¯t clean the entirety of my apartment (900 sq ft) and I never feel like my floor is clean after it runs. It only docks itself half the time even though I placed the charger in a spot with 6 feet on either side and in front, as the directions say, which has to be in my hallway which is an eye sore. With my DeeBot I could charge it underneath my entertainment center which was hidden and out of the way and it would still find its way back 100% of the time. I went to go run my vacuum today only for it to say it had low battery- it¡¯s been charging all night! It¡¯s incredibly loud as well. The only redeeming quality of this vacuum is the customer service. I¡¯ve had to interact with them a few times because of an issue I was having with the vacuum and their responses and mail deliveries are always prompt. Otherwise, please go buy another brand. I had my DeeBot for over two years of daily use until it finally broke down and I thought I¡¯d try another brand. Big mistake.

  I have always wanted a vacuuming robot, and was excited to put it to work. We don¡¯t wear shoes in the house and with hardwood floors, you notice every piece of debris either by sight or feel.We bought this at a big-box store and tried hard to love it after a week trial, but ultimately ended up returning it and getting a new Dyson V10 for $50 more.The fact that it cleans is undisputed: the proof is in the bin. Even on floors that appear to be clean, it still can get a lot of hair that would go unnoticed. We liked the way it would hug walls and used the rotating side brush to get into the corners. The issues were with how it cleans and how much attention it required to operate properly, in addition to continued cost-of-ownership through part changes at set intervals.As stated in the function description, it cleans at random: only changing course when it encounters and obstacle. The randomness may be acceptable to some, but when you¡¯re looking at the same debris in the same open spot after two days and have to use a regular vacuum to pick it up, you tend to question what you paid for.Also, the preparation required to make it work properly completely negates the convenience of automation. You will have to pick up everything that could get moved or ingested by the vacuum (shoes, cords, bathroom rugs) and actually move things around so that it doesn¡¯t get stuck (chairs, coffee tables, remembering to close doors to bedrooms). Even with all of this preparation, I would still get an app alert while at work that told me the vacuum got stuck on something or died in a corner while trying to find its way home.Perhaps spending a few more hundred dollars on a premium unit would resolve some of the problems, but others are just inherent in the nature of asking a machine to do something without human intervention.

  I have considered purchasing this item for several years as a dog owner, and finally decided to get it. I run the vacuum once a day so far. It is not the smartest, I am perplexed the paths it chooses although I think it does a ok job picking up dog hair and dust on this daily basis. The bin is quite small for the amount of hair my dog delivers around the house. So, most likely I will have to run the vacuum more often and try to limit it to the dog¡¯s favorite room. While it is convenient to have to avoid the accumulation of dog hair, it is definitely not a replacement for a real vacuum.

  I was so excited to get this. Although I am home most days, I thought how cool will it be to have a vacuum that vacuums while I am doing something else. I wish this little baby would¡¯ve worked out but here is why it didn¡¯t:1.) Biggest problem - would not get up on higher pile/plush  rugs (think shag) and even when put on the rug - would not travel and clean.2.) I found myself watching it work on the flooring it would travel on - no rhyme or reason and that drove me nuts. Now I admit- this was MY problem for watching it do it¡¯s job. So - should you buy one (which BTW - if you have mainly uncarpetted or lower pile carpeting - go for it! What a wonderful convenience) do one of two things. Either buy the Roomba with the mapping feature OR leave the house or work on a different floor of the house so you don¡¯t see the irrational pattern flow (it does seem to EVENTUALLY hit all the spots.3.) it did not return to the docking station as it was suppose to.Let me close by saying I really really wanted to love this machine - the reality of under beds and furniture getting vacuumed on a regular basis made me giddy. And I think I would still be thrilled with a machine that had mapping and worked on my shags. So don¡¯t be too hastily turned off to a Roomba if these would not be issues for you.

  This is the worst robot vacuum I have owned! I assumed being a Roomba that it would be fairly intuitive, however it was nearly impossible to connect to the app. It gets stuck everywhere and can't maneuver out of the places it gets itself into. If it gets bumped slightly on its charging base it dill not reconnect itself, rather it will just let its battery die. Finally, for whatever reason, if you cancel a cleaning and send it back to its home base it will random travel around your house for another solid 15 minutes going nowhere near the base. There are cheaper options out there that are so much better than this machine.

  <U+00A0>I raised my couch and recliner so the vac could clean under neight. The only issue is it some times gets caught on the toe kick of my kitchen cabinets. But keeping the hair picked up after 2 Doberman pinchers is a job and this little vac does the job.

  I was amazed at how much dust this thing collected on it's first use. One thing I learned is that it will get tangled up in electric cords that lie on the floor so try to have them out of the way when you want it to run. This is not the most sophisticated model so it runs randomly around the floor but eventually cleans it all.  A more expensive model might run a tractor-like pattern but I am happy with the job this thing does. I don't have any pets so I did not rate it for picking up pet hair.

  Honestly I like this vacuum because all I have to do is turn on my wifi and press a button and have clean floors in my house. That's my favorite thing about this robot. The suction I'm neutral about. It does aimlessly wander not knowing where it had just cleaned up. I really can't complain too much about it otherwise. I turned it loose through the house and it just leaves that much less for anyone else I ask to do in the house. My biggest con is it doesn't get corners very well. Otherwise I love having a cleaning robot around especially for when I can't get my kids to do the vacuuming. I turned it loose in my mother's bedroom and it picked up hair she had no idea she had lost over the last several years especially since she couldn't get under her bed or way behind her desk. We actually love this thing.

  Best investment.  Purchased as a birthday present so I didn¡¯t need to vacuum every other day.  Love this!  Have 4 pets and the hair was getting to be unmanageable.  Need to clean the vacuum every other day (empty dirt trap and clean the pet hair off the brushes) but is so much nicer than doing the cleaning of the floors by myself.  I run when at work, and it does get stuck at least once a week.  Usually on a stray sock, cat toy, or on a power cord.  The app will send me a message letting me know.  Is easier to run when in the house so can help when stuck, which defeated some of the purpose of buying, but I will never live without a Roomba again!

  I wasn't sure I needed a robot vac and felt like it was a little indulgent, but now having used it twice, I don't know how I ever lived without it. This is a basic model without as many features as the more sophisticated and expensive models, but for a small house or apartment it does a great job. I love that it can get to places that are hard to reach like underneath the bed, and it did a great job picking up pet hair. It's relatively quiet and can be controlled using the app on your phone. It snagged on some loose rug fringe but that's my fault for not trimming it. When it has a problem, you'll receive a error message on your phone and can fix it easily.

  We vacuum our home once a week with an upright vacuum cleaner. It works great but we just don't have time to vacuum more often to keep up with the volume of pet hair that collects rapidly. We purchased the Roomba as a ""supplementary"" vacuum cleaner that we run nightly that has helped tremendously with collecting pet hair in between our weekly vacuums. I really do like the Roomba but can't give it 5 stars as I don't want to mislead others in believing that you'd never have to vacuum yourself again. If I had to rely on just this device to vacuum my home,  I don't believe that I'd be as satisfied. It is random and has to be redirected often as it sometimes gets lost and can't find its way out of some rooms.  It also gets stuck a lot which causes you to have to pick it up and move it. I really don't mind but I definitely couldn't turn it on when I'm not home as it does require some supervision. Overall, I am happy with it and am glad that I have this device to help clean my home.

  I bought a Roomba 3 years ago and really liked it but it got worn out, the handle broke and it seemed like it wasn't picking up very well despite cleaning it extremely well.I bought this model and it certainly is more advanced with the biggest feature having the connection to your iphone so you know when it is stuck, etc.  But there are few features that I do not like such as the bin to empty the dirt.  This bin is very hard to open, the door gets stuck and I feel like it will break soon.

  This vacuum is great for picking up dog hair (our Great Pyrenees sheds like crazy) and it also picks up typical dust from wooden floors in living room and carpet in bedrooms. The random pattern is tricky, as some areas get more coverage than others. The solution is the more expensive models with row patterns and area mapping, but at a cost of two or even three of this particular model. Buying this on sale was an overall good investment.

  We resisted for years and finally decided to try. It has been one week and I say what good is a robot if it can¡¯t see or if it has no memory! True on both counts. It can¡¯t find the base, it wanders off to farthest corners of the house, without cleaning the areas on the way. Then it can¡¯t return to base. I am not ready to shell out another $100 or so on virtual walls. So I am back to my Dyson and wait another five years then check out the bot world again.

  <U+00A0>Love it! I sweep every day and can¡¯t get up all the dog hair I feel like I constantly walk around with hair stuck to my feet. I pre-swept before the first time I ran the roomba and showed the results in the picture of how much dirt was picked up. The picture was taken the second day after a second run by rumba with even more hair picked up. You can see in the first picture of the debris picked up that it even picked up a heavy washer which is impressive suction power for a tiny vacuum. I love that it can get under most of my tables and cabinets where I have trouble getting all of the dirt out with the broom . Obviously my dogs are not a fan but they adjusted after it ran for a bit.I will say it¡¯s a little louder than I thought it would be but I can still sit and watch TV while it¡¯s running around me downstairs.

  We do have two dogs, but it¡¯s not that big of space and it runs out of juice before it can effectively clean 4 smallish rooms. All wood floors, no rugs so it¡¯s not like it¡¯s struggling with carpet. Also disappointing is it hardly ever finds the base. I always have to carry it back and line it up to charge.

  This is my second robot vacuum. I opted to spend the money because of the reviews and I thought it would be better than the previous one I owned which was half the price. This vacuum is not worth the money. It¡¯s loud, it gets stuck on anything and everything so having a scheduled cleaning is useless unless you¡¯re home, and it seems to do to the same spots and miss many areas. I would opt for a cheaper one if I could go back.

  Very Disappointed in this roomba. I got it for Christmas last year and for a second, I thought it was a huge advancement over the cheap off brand roomba I had before. But, it is nothing but irritation now. It constantly gets stuck (on a ledge, trying to go under the couch, on the piano pedal, etc), misses large areas of a room, only vacuums small areas of rooms and for some irritating reason, seems to always find itself under my desk and under my feet........and won't leave. I know you get what you pay for and if we had bought the more expensive one, it may perform better, but I am not entirely sure it is worth paying more for 1. This one isn't any better than the off brand one I had before. Very disappointed.

  This was my second robot vaccuum, and unfortunately it only served it's purpose for a few months and I will not buy the same model again.  It lost the ability to seat itself properly on the charging station.  So for the first few times I dealt with the problem by setting it on there manually. But after awhile even that became problematic as it would take multiple attempts before it hit the sweet spot.  Sometimes I would give up, and then randomly it would come on later and try again and again to seat itself to no avail.  I did not drop or otherwise damage the unit or the charging station, so I have no idea why this problem started. Boo.

I just got use to putting it back on its charger each time. I tried everything. Cleaned it up like they suggested no luck. Then 2 months ago it kept going in circles. Did what they suggested cleaned brushes, wheels, etc. Didn't matter still went in circles. Now for what ever reason it just won't charge again, so haven't used it in a month. Way to much money for all the troubles its caused. Loved it for the 3 months it worked...

  Actually never had a problem even with 5 small dogs in the house hand cleaning.  Hair was a factor but was hoping this would clean up seed from our pet and rescue parrots.  As many birds as we have living in our living room seed hulls and seed on the floor is a common problem.  Yes our birds and dogs all are part of the family, so they are out to socialize with us, although the birds are in or on their cages based on size most of the day.  Found that this works pretty much as well as a standard pet hair vac to clean up most.  She understood how to control it within 2 minutes of my putting the app on her phone.  Dogs and cats leave hair, birds leave lots of seed hulls and seed outside the cage.  Yes I would purchase this again, does it job without question, was impressed with its cleaning up where we were 2 days since we had ran the vacuum.  Well worth the price, it even cleans up under large parrot cages minimizing the need to move them around.

  My Mom and 2 sisters have been telling me to get a roomba for a couple of years.

  If you have any part of any carpet that has black in it ...  The Roomba will stop and give you an error ...There are what is called CLIFF Sensors, and if those sensors see anything black, they think the Roomba is going off a cliff (or more likely a stairwell) ...  There is NO WAY to turn these sensors off, every web-site about this issue says to tape slips of white paper over the sensors ...  I paid $250 to tape paper over 4 sensors on the Roomba to get it to work ...  Ridiculous !!!  I did the paper trick, worked for awhile, then stopped working ... (Paper got dirty)  so then other sites suggested taking the brand-new Roomba apart (a 2 to 3 hour process with dozens of screws) ....  Pull the LEDs from the sensors and point them at each other ...  Didn't work ...  tried 3 times ...  Hours of frustration ...  Brand new Roomba, $250 dollars into the trash !!!

  I totally dislike this item because it does not clean the whole area.  It randomly goes around and some areas are never vacuumed.  I spent over an hour with tech support only to be told I would have to pay about $150 to have the them look at it.  Since that is about half the original purchase price I declined.

  First of all, I bought this so I wouldn't have to keep sweeping up cat litter.  All it does is fling the cat litter around, so I'm still having to sweep it up.  Secondly, it just randomly roams around the same areas repeatedly, while bypassing other areas altogether.  I have to follow it around the house and get in its way, or pick it up and move it, if I want it to vacuum any other areas.  I am not impressed and will be returning it.

  I did a lot of research before purchasing this model and the main reason I decided on it is because it said it was good for pets. There are quite a few things I do not like about it.Before sucking up the big fuzzies it blows them up in the air or to an area it already went through. It will also do the same area over and over again. Instead of it going along the walls/baseboards it doesn¡¯t continue, it leaves the area and will go across the room. I tried to send it back to ¡°home¡± it¡¯s docking station and it went around the whole house before I finally picked it up and carried it to the station.I don¡¯t have carpeting so the thing glides along very easily. I pickup all pet toys and electrical wires and I let it go for about 3 hours. The only downside is that it cannot find its way home <U+0001F602> and it blows the hair around instead of picking it up.I was very impressed that when I took it upstairs to clean it sensed the edge of the stairs and it turned around.

  I have had this product for about 4 weeks and have used it 4-5 times per week since receiving it.  Maybe twice out of about 18 or so uses did the vaccuum actually make it back to it's home base.  The 'runs for up to 90 minutes before automatically docking & recharging' is fake news.  It runs for as long as it possibly can before dying in the most inconvenient locations, as far out of reach as possible, such as under the bed.  It also has difficulty finding it's home base.  Once it's done cleaning and is attempting to return home (according to the app), it aimlessly wanders around the house, nowhere near where it is supposed to return to.  I gave it 3 stars because it does clean the floors well, but definitely does not work as advertised when it comes to being 'smart', so if you're buying this particular model because of this park, go elsewhere.

  I would have liked to have written an amazing review about this Roomba, but alas it came in a damaged (as in crushed) shipping box, with evidence that it was NOT a new item (broken seals inside). This crushed box was then shipped to me inside a regular larger box to hide the damage. So, what did I find inside? A dead Robot. No amount of charging would wake the poor thing. It actually looked ok, but obviously something had gone quite wrong. It was dead. I did inspect it carefully and these are the things you may be interested in: It has only one side brush - I thought this was odd for a floor vacuum, but clearly there is not meant to be another one, so it wasn't just missing. It seems to have extra sensors so it won't fall down the stairs - I assume that is what they were for, since I was never able to test it. It has two main brushes that should work in tandem with one another. The Dust bin is regular in size but then there is a weird half cone shaped filter inside of it that takes up a lot of space, so if you could use it there is lots less room for it to actually collect dust. meaning you would have to empty it more often. It does come with a charging dock and cord, it comes with an extra cone filter. It does NOT come with a remote. Since it was DOA that's all I can tell you. so Here are my assumed pros and cons:Pro:it looks nicedual main brushesextra filterdocking stationCons:No remoteonly one side brushfilter takes up a lot of bin spacedocking station power cord must come out only on the right, no option to direct it to the left

  My husband had always wanted a Roomba. Obviously I was just as intrigued as the next person with the idea of a robot vacuum, but I never saw the need. Then my husband bought one on and whim and boy, oh, boy. There is no going back for me.Does this Roomba replace a traditional vacuum in a home with three kids, three cats, and a dog? No. But does it help keep said home a whole lot cleaner? Yes!While I do still vacuum frequently, it¡¯s not nearly as often as it used to be. Sometimes I actually vacuum WHILE the Roomba is vacuuming. We¡¯re like a little vacuuming duo and it honestly just makes my heart happy to work alongside my little robot buddy.The Roomba won¡¯t do any deep cleaning, so I will still suck up hair and dirt with my upright vacuum after the Roomba has finished. But it goes the other way as well. I can vacuum a room, then send out the Roomba and it picks up stuff I missed. If you don¡¯t have animals, I think a Roomba could easily be all you need to keep your floors clean.Where the Roomba really shines is for under furniture. If you have animals that love to sleep under couches and beds, you know how hairy things can get under there. I wouldn¡¯t vacuum under my bed nearly often enough. Who wants to be pulling out a huge bed, especially in a small space? Send in the robot! I couldn¡¯t believe how clean the Roomba got the floor the first time I had it clean under my bed!And I love the spot clean feature! I¡¯ve used it on small rugs, to clean up tiny bits of glass after a cup was dropped on the floor, and one of my favorite ways to use it is as a dust pan. I put the Roomba on spot mode and then I sweep toward it. So much easier and faster than sweeping everything into a dust pan.We loved scheduling the vacuum to clean at night while we slept so we could wake up to a freshly vacuumed floor. But then our dog pooped on the floor in the night. I will say that the Roomba did a fairly decent job at cleaning it up. But needless to say, we don¡¯t do that anymore. Now I just start it first thing in the morning.My only complaint is the rotating bristle brushy thing. It started squeaking on the second day we had the Roomba. My husband has to keep greasing it, but the squeaking always comes back in a couple days. Other than that though, this thing is pure magic. If you¡¯re on the fence, just go ahead and get it.

  <U+00A0>We used to have an Ecovacs brand and used it for more than 2 years before we decided it's time to get a new one. Because of good reviews, I decided to get this Roomba model. This has the strangest behavior. I have an area rug in our family room that has black prints on it. The Roomba sees it as an obstruction and avoids it. It took a video so you can see that it's avoiding the black prints on the rug. That's the area on the rug that needs cleaning the most as that's where the pet hair and dirt is most visible.

  We have 4 dogs and keeping up with shedding is near impossible. The Room a does a great job of tracking down the fur and not just spreading it around. Setup was super easy and now it's controlled by my phone. Older models had remotes that never seemed to work correctly. All in all a great little vacuum

  Where to start? I shed a lot of hair (long, thick) and it has always been a problem. Having guests over was such a pain sometimes just because of all the floor cleaning I had to do to get rid of hair.To make it short, this is no longer an issue. Crumbs on the kitchen floor are no longer an issue. Dusty corners are no longer an issue. I use it 3-4x a week on tile and carpet, and may I just say, dreams do come true.

  I purchased a Roomba in early July as a gift for my daughter.  She LOVED it until if stopped working a few weeks ago, she Got an error message about BIN.  She ordered a new bin, did not resolve the issue.  Contacted Amazon was told to contact Roomba direct.  Roomba said they would send a box to return Roomba (without battery) to them ASAP.  It's been several weeks and still no box.  I have also read where others have purchased Roomba batteries via Amazon and received no support from Roomba when there was an issue with their batteries... What exactly is the story, if we purchase Roomba products from Amazon does consumer get no support?  I really would like to know if and when my gift to my daughter will be serviced.Thank you, Grammie in Louisianna

  This product is awful. It runs into furniture and baseboard so hard that most of my things are now covered in scuff marks and scratches. Hair is constantly stuck in it. It works basically like a pinball and ends up doing the same area of floor over and over, which makes the scuffing and scratching on the furniture even more severe. Might be okay if you have dark trim and a lot of durable furniture, but otherwise it¡¯s terrible.

  My unit had a hard time cleaning up anything. It kinda just blew things around and ran over it without really sucking up the majority of things. Additionally, it got stuck in my doorway because the lip of the carpet was too high (even though it shows in the pictures that should definitely be able to climb over it). It also wasn't able to go over my rug, which wasn't that high either.

  Love this little guy! I have a HUGE dog (160 lbs) who sheds a LOT (Anatolia shepherd, so its medium length hair) and I hated how often I had to vacuum.  Ever since Skittles (that's the new iRobot vac) came into my life, I wake up daily to clean floors.  He starts his daily routine at 6 and is usually done by about 730....as an added bonus, its hilarious to watch the dog act like he's going to eat Skittles only to chicken out and run away at the last moment.

  ¡°Heather¡± does rather well at picking up dirt and hair but she has the hardest time rolling into the kitchen. We have two raised dividers that lead into the kitchen; one of the dividers completely immobilizes her 98% of the time. It¡¯s the weirdest thing tho bc both barriers are the same height but she only manages to get stuck on one of them. Besides that she loves to lock herself in the laundry room and chase the cat around. Maintenance parts are rather expensive, so factor that in before you decide to buy.Skip over this model and buy a robovac with smart mapping.

  I recently bought this Roomba 675 on Irobot's website on July 5, 2020 and bought a replenishment kit with it and worked great for me or about 1.5 weeks (one and a half weeks) and then after that it just wouldn't clean for me anymore ill tell you why1. vacuum bin would barely let out any air through the back if you put your hand on it, it feels like someone blowing air on you.2. wheels would make a squeaky noise when vacuuming sounds like a chaid r with wheel legs would be VERY ANNOYING.3. I would get an error message on the app saying that I need to remove Roomba's brushes and clean them when The brushes were in correctly i dont see any dust or anything and would still say i need to clean and check them or no reason ABSOLUTELY RIDICOLUS AND FRUSTRATING.4. Will not charge on dock i would get a ""charging error 1"" when its on the dock making the battery not function properly I contacted Irobot for a replacement charging dock and they sent the replacement dock i asked for and the dock base worked for about 2 days before not charging my Roomba I tried to buy a different model of a charging dock like a white one for a Roomba 530. that did not solve the charging error on my roomba VERY FRUSTRATING.5. Cleaning Brushes would wear out fast like Loads of dusts and pet would build and get tangled in the brushes  and would use the brush cleaning ALOT WHICH IS VERY TENSE.6. flexible beater rips off fast and would not work properly.I WOULD NOT BUY THIS CHEAP JOKE $200 DOLLAR ROOMBA BUYER BEWARE I will buy a Roomba I7 or S9+ better. hope this was helpful.

  Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere. This vacuum bumps really hard on things, passes multiple times over the same spot, doesn't pick up all the dirt, and to find the home base starts bumping all the walls until by elimination it gets to the base.

  It'll do a decent job of cleaning loose dirt and the such, but anything that is even slightly stuck to the floor is not going to get cleaned. The driving algorithm is stupid too. It never goes in the direction I want and most of the time it misses the spot that I ran the vacuum to clean even when I use the spot clean option. It's best used in a small room, and you may have to run it several times otherwise it's a skip.

  Not a terrible product, I won¡¯t lie; I may or may not have sat in my underwear for two hours watching it once I first purchased it.During those two hours, I watched a mindless droid slam into the same door at at least twenty times until I finally had enough. (Also my wife may or may not have finally opened said door pleading to end the poor things suffering.)I will say it did some heavy-duty cleaning, but that may be the only pro to this sad little guy. I have about five or six different rooms for it to clean, and to watch him suffer for two hours in the same one did it in for me.

  Not bad overall! Both are in the same price range. The Roomba 675 pros: good quality, well packaged, great on carpets due to the dual brush design, easy to clean, very user friendly app, and it easily got over my doorway saddles which are about 3/4 in high. Cons: Its quite loud if its on hardwood, on carpets its fine. Very poor suction on hard surfaces, but it does eventually get the job done just takes a bunch of passes. Doesn't clean as efficiently in a pattern as the Roborock, it just bounces around. If it gets accidentally bumped while charging, it doesn't return to station as easily and quietly as the E5 does. Battery life much lower compared to the Roborock E4 about 2x. In conclusion its really not a bad robovac. I managed to get the Roborock E5 on sale off amazon for $180 and it performed better than the Roomba in my opinion. The roborock does feel cheaper in design and the app is a bit harder to use, but it has 3x the suction and nearly 2x the battery life. Also, due to the gyroscope built in, it actually cleans more efficiently in a pattern, rather than just random bumping around. In conclusion I stuck with the Roborock E4 and returned the Roomba 675. But if you have alot of carpeting, the Roomba 675 wouldn't be a bad choice. Hope this helped if you are in between those two.

  Forget flying cars, I want more robots to clean my house! This thing is like having a drunk little friend meandering around with a broom. It¡¯s a bit louder than I expected, so I run it first thing in the morning while I¡¯m showering and getting dressed so it¡¯s not disturbing anything. I¡¯ve run it through the house twice now and it completed every room except the master suite. (I blocked that area off because I had stuff in the floor.) It took about 45 minutes to clean around 1600 sq ft. but it did a good job. I expect it would take it another 15-20 to do the master bedroom and bathroom, so it can do a 1700-1800 sq ft house in an hour.I was amazed at how much stuff it picked up considering I have vacuumed every single day this week with a regular vacuum before getting the Roomba. I was hesitant to spend the money on this but I¡¯m glad I did. My kids and dog track things in constantly and I think this is going to be very helpful.

  This is the dumbest roomba I have ever had.  I have had roombas for 15 years and the navigation on this one is the worst.  Constantly only cleans one area, or completes its job after onlyGoing in circles around the dock area.  Spend more and get one with better navigation.

  Bought this for myself for my birthday in Dec 2019. In Oct of 2020 it still works so well. We run it 5 days a week in the mornings in the main part of our home and close it in bedrooms of an evening while we are eating dinner. Make sure you empty after every use and it will pick up all sorts of muck in your house. We have a 3 & 1/2 year old child that loves ¡®Rosie¡¯ as well as a yellow lab and an American short haired cat. Between the 5 of us, we make a MESS and I¡¯m so glad we can easily vacuum daily with our busy work, school and general schedules.

  I really wanted to love this but it just did not meet (or come anywhere near) my expectations. I have a multi floor house with all tile and super low pile (Ruggable) rugs but I also have two dogs and three cats so I need help keeping up. I ordered 2 of these based on reviews and I ended up returning them and replacing them with a massively more effective competitor. The Roombas were LOUD <U+2014> like holy cow loud. They didn¡¯t pick up nearly as much hair or debris as their competitor. And they ALWAYS had cliff sensor fails at the top of my stairs so I ended up rescuing them 100% of the time we used them. They cost twice as much for a quarter of the cleaning and 10x the noise level. No thanks.

  I named mine Thickums because every morning after her scheduled clean she is filled completely with dog fur. i have one small dog and live in a 600 sq ft apartment. i felt like i was having to vacuum once or twice a day just to keep up with the dog's shedding. the roomba doesn't really deep clean, and if i spilled something i would probably just reach for my stain hand held vac to clean it up. however, to convenience that the roomba gives me is totally worth it. she goes around for like 30 minutes each morning and i finally feel like i can just live in my home instead of constantly needing to vacuum up pet hair.i do also find the roomba pretty entertaining to watch go around my place bumping into stuff lol

  After wanting one for a long time our friends graciously gave us a Roomba as a house warming gift. Setup was fairly simple but it would get stuck almost daily under our living room couches. I added some after market larger bumpers which have helped make it through a run but it definitely is frustrating at first. Also, it doesn¡¯t seem to detect dirt like the product info says. I¡¯ve seen it go right by debris on my kitchen floor never to return. There doesn¡¯t seem to be any rhyme or reason to the track it follows and the suction is weak. All in all it¡¯s an ok device that we mostly let run in our formal living room and dining room downstairs. Since it was gift we¡¯ll obviously keep it but I wouldn¡¯t buy this model at this price.

  Bought one of the first versions of Roomba years ago.  Unfortunately not much has changed in the over price to novelty of the device.  It¡¯s a cool novelty item but functionality it doesn¡¯t come close to a stand vacuum.  Initial cost, continued maintenance cost and overall cleaning ability doesn¡¯t match the cost of the device.  So far only had it several months and already won¡¯t dock by itself.  The storage compartment for debris is tiny and it doesn¡¯t clean much of the area close to walls or furniture (which surprises me since they can make a self driving car but can¡¯t a Roomba  to properly map a room).  I still have hope that some day this will be a viable device but in the meanwhile buy it as novelty gift for relative but not as a replacement for an actual vacuum.

  It works very well, is easy to program, and almost always finds its way back to recharge. My only complaints are that it is pretty thick and will get wedged under things, doesn't always backup when detecting a ""cliff"" which means you have to go save it (it does alert you through the app when both of these things happen and you can have it make an audible sound to make it easier to locate), and finally, (this is more of an OCD thing) but it only vacuums on a zig-zag pattern so the vacuum lines are not pretty on the carpet.

  Had this Roomba for about two weeks, and I have to say so far so good (let's hope I didn't just jinx myself).  I agree with some other reviewers though, this model does seem to wonder aimlessly.  I do start with a relatively ""clean"" floor.  I let it run everyday and figure that ANYTHING it picks up is something I would have to do if I do not have Rosie (my husband named it Rosie after the Jetsons).  I do plan to upgrade it to a better model (if I can find an amazing deal on Black Friday, which is a little more than 1 month away), one that can actually map out the rooms, and have better suction power.  This one does not climb onto my high-pile rug, it sees it as a piece of furniture.  It does climb up to the low-pile rug.  Mine does find ""home"" and so far it'll run for about 2 hours every morning.  So for maintenance, i think this works well.  But if you start with a very dirty room and want this one to completely clean up for you then I think you'll be disappointed, you'll need Mary Poppin's snapping fingers to do that.

  Named it Mo after the robot from Wall-E. Wish it had a fraction of his intelligence. Really expected more from this iRoomba. Mo gets stuck ALL THE TIME on random things that shouldn't be so problematic. He also has a tendency to stay in one section of the house for most of the cycle and where that depends on how he started bouncing around that particular time. I believe newer models allow you to map out your house, but Mo is the very basic unit and enjoys getting stuck on the base of our stools all the time. Not very good for pets either. It gets full rather quickly, which would be expected with long-haired pets, but it would be nice if the bin wasn't so small.

  We've had the Roomba 675 for 4 months and I would not recommend a Roomba product to anyone. Let's start with the Roomba app. Either the 675 is the most basic model or the folks at iRobot/Roomba can't offer any useful options in their app unless you spend over $300. for the 675, the only options are to set a schedule or start a cleaning job immediately. That's it. Apps for ther less expensive robovacs will also spot vacuum right where you put the device, vacuum just one room, vacuum the edge of an area, send the device back to its charger, or maneuver the robovac's direction from the app. iRobot/Roomba's app is pretty sad in comparison.The 675 is also a very tall device. It frequently gets stuck under cabinets and appliances if a rug or mat is too close by, so those have to get picked up every night if we don't want the 675 pinned down. On other rugs, if the 675 moves off of them at just the right angle, it tips in a way that shuts it down. The 675 can make it interesting to wake up and see if it found a new way to tell us how we need to set up our home so it can do its job.Save yourself $50-$75 and get something other than a Roomba 675. Solid marketing is no substitute for a solid product.

  Purchased this for our 1,400 square foot home that has multiple surfaces such as carpet, laminate and linoleum. This Roomba has no trouble going over each surface or conforming to each surface. The Roomba was easy to set up and connected to the phone app without any issues or frustrations. The app will alert you when the Roomba has finished its ""job"" or if the Roomba itself is stuck in a location (it gets stuck often and will absolutely eat your charges and cables). The Roomba will return to the docking station to charge once it has done it's job. The collection container is pretty small, but holds a lot of debris and can be easily dumped. There is a large button on the top of the machine that turns it on and there is also a button to quit the job and return to docking station. There is a battery symbol that lets you know at all times the battery life. Our family owns a small, short haired dog and the Roomba does a pretty good job of picking up hair and debris, although we also let the Roomba go over a room twice before moving on. Recommend for convenience but not a replacement for vacuuming.

  Had this for 11 months. We live in a 2 bedroom apartment with hardwood floors. We've used it no more than twice a week during this time. The battery was able to hold a charge long enough to vacuum every room for about six months. Then it started dying half way through the job. As of today, the entire unit will not charge for more then 2 minutes while on the dock, then stops charging. If I adjust it every couple of minutes I *might* be able to get half of the living room done by....Christmas.I have to admit I absolutely loved it when it first arrived. It cleans everywhere I cannot reach and do not have time to do, as a working mother of 2 with 2 dogs. However, like most things, it put up an excellent show for the honeymoon phase, before withering away and becoming essentially useless.

  I purchased the iRobot 675 three months ago and was amazed at the positive side of what it does like clean under beds and in corners, etc. However, I've found the quality of the machine and the maintenance a complete turnoff. I've followed all guidelines explicitly and now, at 3 months old, I have to wait for a battery replacement that's (you guessed it) out of stock. To her credit, a patient representative from iRobot helped me troubleshoot the battery which was completely dead but I, of course, wonder why the company doesn't just replace the whole unit. It's cost me mega time and money to accommodate the robot since it backs off black border rugs which meant replacing my dark area rugs with lighter ones. It just seems to me a company should bend over backwards to accommodate a customer, not the other way around. Unfortunately for me, I kept it past the return date because I wanted it to work so badly, and now I'm stuck with it. Do not buy the 675 and find out what impediments to operation you need to be aware of. For me, the 675 is an extremely pricy duster.

  We've heard nothing but good things from friends and family who have Roombas, so we thought we'd give it a try. The first thing we were told was, ""Make sure you spend the money for the real thing: the others may be a lot cheaper, but they're headaches waiting to happen.""  Okay, fine, but the 675 isn't exactly a bank breaker, especially if you get it during a sale. And if we just made our lives easier AND avoided l'agita for less than $250, that's even better.I don't care about packaging until it's inadequate or off-the-charts excessive, and neither was the case here.The setup was breathtakingly simple - I forgot to breathe for a few seconds when I looked at the unit in the charger and after installing/starting the app, pressing 2 buttons, and naming the robot (""Sucka"" - I know, that's so original), I saw that my phone was reporting that setup was complete.  I thought, ""Really, that's it?  What'd I miss?"" As it turns out, I missed nothing. Easy-peasy.  So, I thought I'd just let it charge overnight and then I'd play with it the next day.The next day, while working in my home office, I started the app and selected ""Vacuum Everywhere"".  I heard it wake up with cheerful little beeps and start working.  It really isn't too loud, so between meetings I followed the sound, coffee in hand, to watch it work.  I was kind of fun to watch it careening around like a drunken toddler, gently crashing into stuff and bouncing counter-clockwise until it could move again. I half-expected it to exclaim, ""Uh-oh!""  And if something was light enough, it just pushed it around until it hit something solid enough to make it bounce.  I wish I'd waited until after working hours so that I could watch it with an adult beverage or two.  The 14-year-old in me is definitely going to set up some obstacle tests.Like any toddler, it requires a little bit of supervision. It got stuck on a thick power cable beneath a bed, so it beeped, called out with a voice to ask for help, and alerted my phone app; I rescued it and sent it on its way.  (Note to 14-yr-old-self: see if there's a way to hack the firmware to change the voice alerts to something really wrong. Maybe a toddler-like voice yelling, ""Aw, s**t!"" or ""FML!"")Also like a toddler, it eventually needs a diaper change and a feeding/nap. After a while, I had to empty the dust bin and pull some hair off of the brushes and wheels, so I put it back on the charger for a bit.  So, it's napping right now. After lunch, I'll fire it up again and see if it finds its way into my office.It may need some decoration, too.  Maybe some googly-eyes and a rude bumper sticker? Or a tiny pirate flag flying from the rear?So, for the important part: does it clean well?Yes. Judging from look of the floors and the amount of crud in the dustbin, it does a solid job.  And, apparently, I don't: my weekly floor sweeping/Bona mopping appears to be missing some stuff.Ah, the app tells me that it's already back to full charge (just under 2 hours!), so I'm gonna turn Sucka loose again.

The first couple of uses I wasn't sure how it was going to work out because it took quite a while to get the area done.  But the AI seems solid.  So now it has learned the layout and has cut the cleaning time in half.The App is really useful.  It has let us know when the irobot has become stuck. We have set it to go off in the morning every other day.  Definitely pick up everything from the floor! (Might be a good way to get the kids to pick up their toys) also close doors to any place you dont want it to go.  Block access to small spaces it could get stuck under.Lol for me, I had a really low bar of expectation it had to meet - I just wanted it to make it back to its docking station! - but the bar was met.My only complaint is that the charging cord is a little lose at the charging station.

  Where do I start when I saw I am so happy to have ""Zoomba"" in our apartment. I did a sweep through while the iRobot was charging and prior to letting it do its thing. Let's just say that I am clearly terrible at sweeping because what was picked up by the vacuum was enough to build another small dog. Our iRobot isn't perfect and seemed obsessed with cleaning the living room and around the dog bowl. It barely came into the bedroom or closet but when it did, it cleaned very well. We have it running on a schedule and after EACH cleanup, we do a thorough cleaning of the dust bin, wheels, and filter so that it is ready for the next cleanup. Because we have long-haired dogs this is crucial for maintenance and we want this iRobot to last a very long time.

  Let me preface this review with saying I love my Roomba. It has saved me so much time from vacuuming. However, I was really hoping for something that you just leave and it vacuums multiple rooms on 1 charge. And that¡¯s not what happens. It has a battery of about 1 1/2 hours which lasts for one large room. If there are multiple doors open, it usually gets lost and then can¡¯t find its docking station to recharge and runs out of battery. What I do is put it in a room with the door closed. When it finishes that room, I pick it plus the docking station up, move it to another room, close the door, and it vacuums that room. So it takes me 2 to 3 days to vacuum our 3000 square-foot house because I have to move it from room to room and it eventually loses its charge and then needs at least an hour to fully charge. It does an amazing job though.

  This product worked as it should during the first six months I had it. After that, the battery started to go. I live in a 500 sq feet apartment and this would die after going through 1/3 of the space. Now, the battery does not charge at all even after cleaning the charging port. The vacuum is essentially useless. If you're looking for a short-term vacuum, then sure. But not something that lasts.

  We've had our iroomba for a few weeks now, and I'm not super impressed. It does clean the floor in ideal conditions. It has a hard time going over transitions like tile to carpet. It gets stuck a lot. When it runs out of battery it just stops wherever it is and we ha e to go get it and pick it up and put it back on the charger. It bumps into everything and not lightly either. It is surprisingly loud, like can't watch TV or have a conversation loud. Will probably find something else that is a little more advanced.

  Great entry level robot vacuum. We use this to clean the hardwood and rugs in our living room and kitchen and it does a great job cleaning up all the cat and dog hair and all the dirt the pets bring in. The floors are spotless after it runs a full cycle. The Roomba app is great and you can easily set your cleaning schedule or start a new cycle while you're away. You do have to make sure any loose objects are off the floor, so as we leave for the day we take 2 minutes and move the pet food bowls and anything else up and out of the way. Same for any loose cords or curtains that are hanging on the floor.Knocking off one star because it sometimes sometimes freezes when it goes to far out over the ledge between our living room and family room that's one step down. 95% of the time it senses the ledge and turns around, but other times it goes too far out and gets stuck. You have to turn it around yourself and press start again to get it back running. It also sometimes get stuck under the couch. Our couch is just the right height that the Roomba can get under the couch in one certain spot, but then gets stuck. If it was a fraction taller or shorter, it would work just fine. It can be annoying when you expect it to clean the whole area, but get's stuck after just a few minutes of cleaning.It also seems to have a hard time finding it's docking station after it gets done cleaning. It's probably our fault in where we located the docking station, but this spot works for us and is out of the way. We just have to pick up the dead Roomba and carry it back to the dock. Not a huge deal, and the convenience of the robot vacuum outweighs the issue of having to carry it back when it's done.Due to the layout of our house, if it finds it's way into the bedrooms/office, it would usually get stuck back there, so we block off that area of the house now. We didn't feel like spending the large amount of extra money to buy a vacuum that comes with house mapping, so we still vacuum those areas with our cordless stick vacuum.If you're hoping this vacuum will clean your entire house and return to it's charging dock perfectly, you probably need to spend the extra money and buy one with mapping features. But, if you want a vacuum to thoroughly clean you main living areas and save a little money, this is the one for you.

  I've been wanting a Roomba for a long time and I've really impressed with this model for the price. It generally finds its way home after about 1.5 hrs of cleaning. Sometimes it gets stuck because I have a high carpet in one area but its not an issue, I just pick it up and restart it. I don't recommend having it run when you're not home because it can get stuck and just sit there until it dies. The suction is great. I'm honestly surprised with how much it picks up. I don't need a normal vacuum because of this Roomba!

  so to answer each claim...  CLEAN SMARTER - The 600 series is a great way to begin cleaning your home smarter. Just schedule it to clean up daily dirt, dust, and debris with the iRobot HOME app or your voice assistant. - for effortlessly clean floors.I have not tried this  LOOSENS, LIFTS, & SUCTIONS - The 3 Stage Cleaning system & Dual Multi-Surface brushes grab dirt from carpets & hard floors, an Edge-Sweeping brush takes care of corners & edges.  LEARNS YOUR LIFE LISTENS TO YOUR VOICE - Learns your cleaning habits to offer up personalized schedules, while Google Assistant & Alexa allow you to start cleaning with just the sound of your voice.  ADAPTIVE NAVIGATION - A full suite of advanced sensors allow Roomba to navigate under & around furniture, & along edges. Cliff Detect keeps it from falling down stairs.  SENSES & ELIMINATES DIRT - Dirt Detect Sensors alert your robot about dirtier areas of your home, like high-traffic spots, & cleans them more thoroughly.  CLEAN FLOORS EVERYDAY - Provides a system of cleaning features & smart sensors that allow the robot to adjust to your unique home & deliver a daily clean.  CLEANS CARPETS & HARD FLOORS - Auto-Adjust Cleaning Head automatically adapts its height to effectively clean carpets & hard floors.non of this is remotely true with the possible exception of voice commands which I have not tried.  The thing bumps into the same items over and over, it misses edges more often than not, passes over dirtier area without the slightest pause and we finally covered the 'height sensors' which wont go over anything black.I am honestly surprised roomba has not been sued for false advertising.

  Ive had this since may and overall I dont like it. I had the shark before this one and it was amazing! This one is way louder, it doesn't forsee walls and furniture and runs into it full speed knocking over items on tables, it doesn't always dock itself especially when the battery is low. The shark came with strips that you can lay down to keep it from going in certain places (eg behind my chair the internet is plugged up and I don't like it going back there) with this vacuum the options to achieve this are expensive. I'd send it back if I could but its too late. Next one I buy will be another Shark brand.

  I bought this because of high Wirecutter reviews and am terribly disappointed. Can't believe I spent almost $300 on it.It isn't very good for a whole floor, is designed for only a single room or two. Easily gets lost in a bigger floor area with several rooms and can't find home in time. The noise from the machine is very loud, and even worse is the constant banging into all the furniture, scratching floors and damaging trim.It can't dock properly by itself unless the base is screwed into something, it will just push the base around. If it doesn't dock properly and runs down the battery, it will squawk at high volume demanding to be charged, regardless of time of day. So many nights I woke up to a very loud ""PLEASE CHARGE ROOMBA"" because the battery had died while the robot looked to be on the charging base. Even placing it on the dock by hand it is nearly impossible to line up the charging contacts and the lights on the device don't give a good indication that it's charging or not.Worst of all, I got a new phone and this robot wouldn't connect to it. I wanted to change the schedule I'd set with the previous phone but can't, so I'm cursed to use the bad schedule forever. ""Factory Reset"" didn't seem to do anything. Onscreen instructions don't match up with the design of the 675. When I couldn't connect over wifi, the instructions suggested looking for a wifi network coming from the machine, yet there was none.What a piece of high-promise/low value garbage. In the trash it goes.

  We have hardwood floors and two cats.  You'd think we have a dozen cats the way these two shed.  The Roomba does an outstanding job keeping two rooms clean (livingroom and bedroom).  It's only gotten hung up once in the month we've owned it, and that was on a cord we left on the ground.  We've found that it doesn't like some of our furniture that it can't ""see"" such as an old fashioned rocking chair, but it still manages to clean around it.  It seems to take random paths, but I haven't seen it miss any debris yet.

  I do not recommend this version of the iRobot roomba. It has too many mechanical issues. I bought this roomba as a gift a little less than 2 years ago. I had a previous series of iRobot roomba that I loved. I figured the updated version would be much better, but I was wrong. In less than 2 years, they had to replace the cleaning head module, the front spinning brush, and now they¡¯re having problems getting it to charge correctly. They have let the roomba dock itself and they have tried to manually put it on the charger, but it has to be in just the right position to charge. They have tried changing the charging location. They have tried to leave it on carpet, hardwood, and a flat linoleum floor, but nothing seems to help. It also is frustrating for them that they is not an easy way to tell if it is charging correctly or not. Sometimes it will start charging correctly, but will suddenly stop. They only find out it is not charged is when they go to use it.Like I said, I love the previous version I bought of this. I use mine daily and I haven¡¯t had any issues other than normal wear and tear. They use theirs about once a week and have had a whole host of problems.

  The point of purchasing this vacuum was so that I didn't have to worry about the day to day maintenance of my floors. This is the most needy piece of machinery I own. Constantly stuck on ""cliffs"" (my rug) and getting stuck under numerous items in my home. I've raised several low pieces of furniture but Roomba seems to find a new thing every week to have issue with. It has a 10% success rate of finding the docking station after cleaning. It's in an easy to access location with no obstacles. It will not connect to the charging base, it's incredibly finicky. I can spend 10 minutes adjusting it around and making sure the connection plates are clean to no avail. Waste of money, and far more of an annoyance than a weekly vacuuming. I gave it 9 months to figure it out but the product just kept getting worse.

  I purchased this, as you might have guessed, through Amazon Warehouse.  It was listed as being in ""very good"" condition, in a box that was damaged.  Imagine my surprise when I received this new member of my family filthy and with brushes that were so choked with hair that they couldn't turn.  (The box was trashed too, by the way, and there was no instruction manual or other paperwork enclosed.)  I can only guess that the previous owners of my new family member had owned her for 5 years and made her toil ceaselessly outdoors on their Angora goat farm.  I spent an hour picking hair out of the brushes and wiping the device down.  Judging by the tenacity with which all of the goat hair stuck in the brushes, I suspect that there was bubblegum involved at some point.  It. Was. Gross.  It still is gross.  If this thing vacuums at all I'll be surprised.  I'll update if it does.

  I had a Eufi before the Roomba. The Roomba was more expensive but I was curious about the hype behind the brand. It is more powerful and larger than some of the others. I will say that it's cleaning power is impressive. But what good is cleaning power if it can't get itself back onto the charger and begins to have problems after only 6 months. Additionally, because it's so powerful, it can actually do a lot of damage. It pushes around my end table, knocks things off of other tables, and scuffs up furniture it can roll over. Its motors are very powerful and it can roll over a lot.It also has developed odd behaviors. It will finish the job and get back onto the charger, then three hours later start saying ""Please move roomba to another location"" and ""Please charge roomba"". It also doesn't have a remote control or any other controlling features. You can start it and stop it, that's it. If you want any sort of features you have to buy the more expensive models. And I do mean MORE EXPENSIVE. I talked my partner into buying the $800 version and it's not really any better. After this thing dies I'll probably go back to the Eufi or try one of the others. The Roomba isn't worth the high price tag and doesn't live up to the hype.

  I got this for my family because we have a 6 mo. old and pets and wanted to eliminate hair and dirt on the floors for when she starts crawling. It's good for light dirt and hair, and you have to empty the canister pretty much after each use. I noticed it crossed over the same paths a lot when discovering a room so it didn't clean efficiently. You can program it through the app and it always finds it's way home, unless caught on a rug with tassels.

  This thing sucks. It really does. It will suck up all the dirt and hair in your house.It makes a terrible noise on carpet though. Like a cat screaming...We returned one thinking it was defective but that wasn't it as the other one does the same. WD-40 this thing up around the spinning thingy and its not as bad.We thought about returning it and getting one that isn't annoying but it quickly became part of our family as the app has you name it. So Frieda stayed with us and does her thing once a day while we are out.

  I have all hardwood floors and set it to clean Mondays and Thursdays when I leave the house. I always forget and come home and the house just feels cleaner. There is no dust on the floor when I walk around barefoot. It got stuck the first time I ran it so now I move things off the floor. Every other week I move the couch and chairs away from the wall so it can get back there too. The only thing I don't like is when I am home and Alice runs. Not because it hits me or is too loud, because it will enter a room for 10 minutes and then leave, then come back for 5 minutes, then leave. After the 10th time I get mad and send it home, but it's just my OCD. When I am not home, it's awesome. Looking to get the mopping version soon.

  I love this vacuum!  Previously owned a Samsung robot vacuum and it finally broke after several years.  I tried going without, but honestly, with two cats in the house it was tough.  Rather than dealing with furballs I decided to invest in a new one.Overall, this vacuum does a nice job. It transitions from carpet to hard floor quite well.  There have been some mishaps when it gets caught up on the stair ledge, but I am quickly noticed through the app that the terminator has a problem.  Which is nice.  I am hopeful in time it will learn to avoid that area.This was well worth the money and I have it set to run every day.  It runs for around 90 minutes and cleans the living room, bathroom, hallway and bedroom quite well.  It is not too noisy.It does require emptying after each run, but that is quite easy to do.  Set up was also a breeze with the WiFi.

  I would give this iRobot 4.5 starts. It¡¯s great, not perfect but I¡¯m pretty impressed with how it cleans. It does a nice job getting under furniture, and going a round table legs. I would say it¡¯s totally worth it and wish we got one sooner.After about 10 days of owning it and running it once a day, I swiffered the whole house to see what I would find. I was very impressed with how little dirt I picked up. Normally it would have taken multiple swifter pads and been pretty gross.It does need a little babysitting but not much. It does favor certain rooms, I have to kick it out of the bathroom cuz it will go in the bathroom like ten times.It¡¯s kinda annoying, it bumps into everything and is pretty loud. But you do adjust to it. It sometimes has a hard time docking and will need help.It will clean our 800sf condo with one cat pretty nicely in about 1.5hrs. We have never had it get a full in the middle of cleaning. Works super well for our space.

  First of all, the good things: It cleans quite well and doesn't get hung up on the fringe of rugs like a different brand used to do.  Also, the app is useful for scheduling cleaning times.

  I love the Roomba because it's powerful and the design is great. It gets into corners and under beds -- places that it's hard to get to with a regular vacuum. It's also easy to remove the dirt and there are no vacuum bags to buy. Of course, you cannot use it to vacuum your couch pillows and it gets stuck if your rug has tassles. That's a problem.

  Vacuum does great at cleaning and picking up things other vacuums miss. The problem is the battery only last about 30 minutes instead of the 2.5 hours it says it does. No matter where you put the base the vacuum never is able to make it back to the base and dies randomly when cleaning the floor. Every day we have to pick it up and put it on the base to charge but the other problem is that it almost never charges fully on the base and is super picky about how you put it on the base in order to have it charge. We have cleaned both the base and vacuum several times and the vacuum is almost never able to dock on the base by itself and even if it does dock on the base it almost never is able to charge fully. We are very disappointed in this vacuum for the price.

  I¡¯ve had this vacuum for a little over a month now and I run it every day with minimal issues in my 945sqft house with hardwood, tile & area rugs. Sometimes it gets stuck near the stairs, sometimes it gets wedged under one specific chair & I have to rescue it, once or twice it couldn¡¯t find the dock, but those are all minimal compared to how much time and energy this thing saves me. I just do minimal vacuuming once a week to reach areas she can¡¯t & my house looks and feels so much cleaner all the time! I am not the type who vacuumed every day, because who wants to do that, but I set ¡°Rosie¡± up once to have a cleaning schedule and it¡¯s been good to go ever sense. I have very long hair that sheds like crazy and I also have a cat and dog & am amazed each day with how full the bin gets. She easily clears all the thresholds in the house & fits under beds, nightstands, dressers, etc that are all areas I¡¯m guilty of not vacuuming under as often as I should, but Rosie takes care if it for me. I do like to be at home while she¡¯s cleaning, just in case she gets stuck on something & she is a little noisy, but not as much as a regular vacuum. I recommend this as a great introduction to a robot vacuum.

  I live in a two bedroom apartment and have managed to keep the floors very clean due to my Roomba. We have it scheduled to run 3 times a week, and I'd say it learned the layout of the apartment within the first 2 weeks. It cleans different sections of the apartment on different days, and gets into its groove more as time goes on, so you just have to trust its process at first.The only slightly annoying issue we've had with the Roomba is that once it starts running, the charge only lasts for an hour and fifteen minutes to ~maybe~ an hour and thirty minutes max. There have been 2 or 3 times where it's just died while cleaning, or died while on its way back to the dock, and then I've had to go grab it and place it on the charging dock manually. However, it is a ""robot vacuum"", and so I think you need to expect it to have dumb moments like this sometimes.You have to keep floors fairly clean of small objects to, or else the roomba may get stuck on top of them - I've had it get stuck on my laptop cord, and then again, you have to go manually untangle the cord and move the roomba to get back on track.Regardless, the Roomba purchase was well worth the money for me - I hate vacuuming, and this has saved me the trouble of adding it to my to-do list. The noise is slightly quieter than that of a manual vacuum, too, so that's an added plus. Maybe one of the best features is the app compatibility. The push notifications on the phone alert you if the Roomba is stuck on something, or if the battery is running low, and you can choose to send it home if needed.All around, I'd recommend this purchase to a friend. It might be a little more expensive than a manual vacuum, but to me, the convenience pays for itself.

  This vacuum does a good job cleaning, and it is very convenient that it can be programmed to start early in the morning, or from a smartphone, but...It's also supposed to return to its charging station, and that's something it does very rarely. More commonly, it chokes on something forgotten on the floor, but which is a bit inconvenient, or its battery dies while it tries to find its way back. And it's that last that has me quite annoyed, as it seems to be a really bad error in its programming.When the vacuum gets stuck, I can at least open the app and hear it (usually) complain. When its battery dies, though, it won't respond to the app at all, and I have to hunt all over the house to find it. Surely it could be programmed to give up finding its way back while it still has battery left? The chances that trying just a few minutes longer will result in success seem kind of low if it hasn't actually detected the charger, so it might just as well give up and save its battery.And speaking of which... there should really be a 'find' button on the app so that I don't need to quit it and start over again to get it to make noise.A few years ago, this was probably state-of-the-art. Now it seems to fall far short of what a modern piece of equipment should do.

  Well, I went back and forth for several years before I finally ¡°bit the bullet¡± and purchased this jewel. His name is Tobor and I¡¯m wondering why I didn¡¯t get him sooner! Seriously, my floors have never been cleaner! I can walk around barefoot without feeling like I have gunk on my feet. I have a long haired cat so there seems to always be cat hair as well as my human hair everywhere. I was a little apprehensive about getting him set up as I can sometimes be technically challenged. But this was a breeze. If you can read you can get this thing set up in a few minutes. I got him all charged up and started with cleaned, mopped floors. We have ceramic tile and wood floors with one large area rug and the transition between the difference surfaces is great.  He does run around in a very haphazard way, so if this is gonna bug you, I¡¯d recommend you set him to do his job when you aren¡¯t around. He does get the job done! I have him scheduled to run every morning and he keeps the floors nice and clean! I love the fact that he fits under most of our furniture including the beds! Vacuuming under beds is not my idea of fun. I wouldn¡¯t consider this a method for deep cleaning but it sure is a wonderful addition to our family!

I will say it does pick up lots of pet hair and dust where it goes, but I was expecting it to have some sort of mapping feature and travel accordingly.It¡¯s distractingly LOUD. Like almost as loud as a full size vacuum.The dirt has to be emptied out after each use bc the chamber is pretty small, and sometimes longer hairs/rug fibers get stuck in the brushes and you have to untangle them.Constant pauses/error messages! It gets stuck in the same places and have to rescue it.

  The vacuum itself did a good job of sucking up things on the carpet. But I don't know what was wrong with it. It would go over the same spot a dozen times, missing entire rooms in the house. Then it would die before it was able to dock itself. It was like a little drunk robot stumbling through the house before passing out wherever it landed. It was funny, but didn't work at all how I wanted it to.

  At first I was skeptical. He was nothing more than an ¡°aimless wanderer¡± that everyone referred to him as. Little did I know, he was going to break my heart. This little guy worked day in and day out, never complained, only asked for help a few times (when he got stuck), and always reminded me of how disgusting I was due to the amount of filth he would pick up. Unfortunately, my dogs pooped in the house when I wasn¡¯t home. He dragged it everywhere like you would spread peanut butter on toast. The kitchen, the dining room, the living room, the foyer, the breakfast area, EVERYWHERE was covered. Even the base boards believe it or not (that¡¯s just how thorough he was). It wasn¡¯t until he ran over a blanket that was hanging off the couch when he sucked it up and finally stopped. The worse part is, this was the third time it happened (I know what you¡¯re thinking. Just get rid of the dogs. Trust me, I know). But this time, he just couldn¡¯t be revived. When I flipped him over on the counter to asses the damage, I knew this would be his demise. I couldn¡¯t go through having to take him apart, clean him thoroughly, and reassemble him. Not again. After giving him a proper send off, I subsequently ordered a knew one that very night. I now have a junior and he¡¯s got his fathers bristles. He¡¯s a staple to this family. 10/10 recommend. Dogs pending adoption.

  The time spent cleaning out the dust trap and taking hair off of the brushes is so time consuming. If you don¡¯t clean the brushes each session you won¡¯t get a good clean, the brushes are not sturdy enough to maintain their shape with hair on them. This is a cute gadget that will pick up surface things for about 120 days then it no longer even does that. The side brush, which is critical for edging around hardwood floors, stopped working. This makes the floor look like it was never vacuumed. The carpet has a nice pattern making it appear clean. When I ran my real vacuum over it after a session my real vacuum filled with dirt and dust. It is good for surface light cleaning but I don¡¯t think it¡¯s meant to take the place of your vacuum. Not worth it for how much it cost! You still have to vacuum for real.

  This unit is not smart in any way.  It cleans the same spots over and over and misses other spots. You watch it ram (rather hard) into things repeatedly. It does not learn. It will get stuck in the same places ever time.  It also gets very loud after the first week or so of use. I tried blocking problem areas off, attaching unicorns and bumper pads.  For $10 or $20 bucks it might be a good buy but if you value your sanity STAY AWAY! I'm going to buy a Roborock S4 and throw this thing in the trash.

  I bought the Roomba 675 because I saw it worked well with pet hair and I own 3 dogs and 2 cats (plus my roommates 2 cats at the time of this writing). I really should have done more research before I purchased this and I've had this Rooma since March 22, 2020...Pros: works great on LIGHT colored carpet, easy to maintain (I use a dog grooming brush to clean the bristles of the copious amounts of animal fur), it's easy to locate with the location chime, and the app is pretty straightforward with reminders to clean the brushes and change out the filter.Cons: if you have ANY dark marks on the carpet, the stupid things sensors will get stuck because it detects a ""cliff"" which will then require you to move it to a new location before it can resume operations; it doesn't have very good mapping technology. It goes around the same way and has completely missed rooms and obvious spots of my 1200 sq ft house (half of which I don't even have it clean!) even after I set it up over the uncleaned spots; the battery doesn't last very long (1-1.5 hours of run time before it dies) so if you have a large house you will need more than 1 to clean all of your floors. The battery has died just doing my bedroom, which is only 120 sq ft.Overall, just having it do my bedroom is mostly awesome but the rest of my house is never clean unless I manually vacuum or sweep it. Either the battery dies before it finishes, it gets stuck on the dark patterns on my large living room rug and I refuse to get it since it happens CONSTANTLY (at least 5-6 times in the same spots each time it runs; hence why I say the mapping technology is rubbish), or it just doesn't go into the other rooms.I wish I had gotten a different Roomba...

I have three dogs who have moderate shedding, I usually have to vacuum a couple times a week and who wants to do that when you work all day?

I may as well just take my stand up vacuum and do the job myself. If you live a busy life, this isn¡¯t the one for you. Get the cheapest Roomba you can get.

  <U+00A0>I love my Roomba! Set up was fairly easy. To connect my phone and WiFi I succeeded on the second time. I let it get a fullCharge before I used it. During the cleans, it cleans about one hour and a half before the battery runs dead, which is perfect in my book! In this time it covers my living room, kitchen, hallway and dining room. It picks up so much between our carpet and laminate flooring. One of my best purchases!

  This model misses a lot of debris on the floor.  Several times, I have put small pieces of debris in the path of this unit and it went right over them without picking it up.

  The Roomba has a difficult time parking in its charging base. It tries. It actually climbs in to the base then fidgets left and right to try and connect. It then leaves the base and dies somewhere else in the house. We try to place it manually on n the base bit to get it to charge we have to prop it up on the left side to make contact with the charger. This takes about 15 minutes.  I contacted customer service and they did not respond to address. Rather they sent a survey to ask how the customer service I got was and claimed I got an email response. I was not nice on my survey and finally got an email asking for pics which I sent. No response. This place is our second Roomba but most like our last. They are too expensive to risk a lemon.

  I thought there was good chance that our new friend ""Norbert"" would spread cat litter around the house (more than it already gets spread).  However, Norbert does a surprisingly good job.  He has not fallen down the stairs either which is a huge plus.We have found that if we lock Norbert in a room by himself that he does a better job than if you give him full run of the house.  His mind has a tendency to wander a little in that regard so constraining his territory makes it more likely that he'll find all of the cat hair ""tumbleweeds"", litter, dirt from outside and other stuff that happens to hit the floor.Norbert, despite his relatively low IQ and seemingly random movements, apparently recognizes both of our cats and apparently has an appetite for cat tails.  Our furry friends have decided that avoiding Norbert's brushes and wheels is best and make for high ground when they hear him start his cleaning routine.Overall, Norbert joining our house has made our lives easier by giving us time to no longer do the vacuuming ourselves and instead spend time watching him creep across the floor, under chairs and into some of the areas of our house that we realize that we should have vacuumed ourselves before he came into our lives.  Never has an animated object garnered such attention and entertainment in our house from all of use (cats and humans).  We cheer every time he finds a chunk of dirt and face-palm when he bumps into the same four legged chair for a few moments.  If the cats decide that they decide he is a mode of transportation for their lazy asses, I will update this review.  However, the manufacturer says that Norbert is not a cat transport device (contrary to ample evidence supplied by YouTube).

  <U+00A0>Right out of the box, one of the brushes is smooshed and will not bend back into shape (see picture). The instructions say the machine is half charged upon arrival. The unit shows a dead battery but, the app shows over half (see pictures). The machine ran for almost an hour so I am not sure what is going on with the battery indicator. The air flow that comes out of the back of the machine is so strong at times it pushes dirt away from the machine instead of allowing it to pick it up. I have set it up for voice control with Alexa which I find amazing. This thing will also vacuum black carpet. I know it doesn¡¯t look black in the video, but that is a black rug ladies and gentlemen! The machine has no flow about it, but I think it may be figuring out the layout. I really don¡¯t care if the thing goes in circles all day. I am not the one vacuuming. It is not as quiet as I would have hoped but, it is quieter than my vacuum.

  <U+00A0>I LOVE this item so very much for taking care of the dog hair my hounds leave behind in the house.  I literally run it every single day and it keeps dust and hair off my floors.  I have tile, wood, and some carpet areas.  It doesn't have as much suction as my main vacuum, but it's great for a daily treatment and makes me only have to get out the cumbersome vacuum a few times a month for corners and deep cleaning.  The negative and reason for 4 stars is that i do often have to cut the hair off the roller in order for it to work at peak performance.  Also, the filter often needs cleaning as it does pick up quite a bit of dust.  I have 2 dogs and 2 teenagers (and their friends) so I guess I get a lot of hair and dust in my home!  I love it though because I know my home is getting vacuumed daily so it at least looks nice if a guest drop bys and keeps my time open to do other things.  I have had it for 8 months now so felt it was an honest review.

  Overall, I think this is a great investment for our family. A few issues keep it from being a 5 star item:  1) It's noisy.  2) It's infuriating to watch it go right past debris and never return. 3) It eats long drapes.  4) It gets stuck on patio door track.  But it's still easier than pushing around  a vacuum. I picked up a handheld vac so I could spot clean the items it misses. With 3 cats I had to have something to pick up the drifting hair bunnies as needed.  We also had to correct all the drapery rod heights so there is NO puddling of drapes on the floor. As for the patio door issue, it only occurs on a very long expanse with three tracks. I just put someting in front of it before vaccuming, problem solved.

  I spent quite a bit of time researching robot vacuums and for what I wanted, I landed on this one. We have 2 medium - 55lb dogs. 1 with short hair and the other with long hair so that's truly my biggest focus. We also have carpet and hardwood floors so I wanted something that would move easily from one to the other. With that said, I'm impressed with how well it transitions. Even with rugs on the hardwood, no issues. I'm also happy with how easy set up was and how easy it is to get the robot going / scheduled. Literally tell it to clean (push the button, tell Alexa, push clean on the app, etc) and it takes off.  I read reviews that the 675 is better with dog hair compared to others in their 900's series so that was honestly a deal breaker for me. Cleaning / emptying it after it runs is also super easy. Personally, we didn't want to put tape on the ground so I liked that we didn't have to with this. It has gotten stuck on the bathroom rugs so before we run it, I just shut the bathroom doors - not a big deal. But the cons.. The biggest is it's so loud! We were hoping to schedule running it at night, but that's not an option as it will wake you up even if it's just on the other side of the house. The other con that I've honestly ""gotten over"" is the random lines it creates on the carpet. It jumps all around so afterwards, don't expect pretty straight lines like you'd create with a vacuum, it will look more like a maze is on the carpet - super random lines.

  This cleans up so much dust and cat hair.  I am very pleased at how well it removes particles from the floor.  I bought it to clean under the beds but it works great on the living room carpet.  I feel comfortable having the 1 year old twins crawling around after it cleans.  Dirt cup is easy to empty and extra filter in nice as I can wash one and use the other.  Clean up all the cat toys and wires as this will suck them up along with the dirt. Goes from bare floors to carpet without trouble.

  For wood floors it is very noisy.  Carpet is much quieter.  I was looking forward to this so much. I haven¡¯t had it more than 2 months and the one spinning brush needs replacement already. I had such high hopes. I wish I had returned it when I had the chance. Save your money.  Not worth the price. I was so excited when it arrived. Just disappointed.

  it's a nice gadget, but it isn't a substitute for a good sweep and mop. Something to use for in between cleaning days. I actually spent a lot of time walking around preparing the floor for it to clean, as in removing floor mats, cables, anything loose on the floor that could get tangled up in it. This isn't a true vacuum, Because there is no suction. There's really only brushes that sweep the stuff into a small reservoir. I enjoy it, we named it Sheeloo, and I even put some googly eyes on it. We have a nice hardwood floor, so it isn't that hard for it to just go around and clean up the dust, hair, dust bunnies.

  Definitely not for deep cleaning in my opinion, but it's nice to keep the floors tidy if I don't want to sweep or vacuum every day or even every week. The app is easy to use, and the vacuum is easy to cleanMy only complaints are the fact that it doesn't go in a straight line or pattern.

  Update: A month in & I have Roomba proofed my apartment. Requires 7 separate fixes to prevent my iRobot getting stuck (cushion blocks my recliner base, shoes block multiple places under furniture, lift towel off bathroom floor, leave open one door to prevent Roomba running over Apple device charging wires getting torn up & couple of others). Frequency of complete cycles increased to 4 a week, 5th day the battery runs out before Roomba can make it home. Still a disappointing 3 stars, performs a needed job at my home.It¡¯s probably my fault for expecting faultless operation & some Robot characteristics. Truth is my 675 gets stuck 4 days out of 5 when it runs in my 1250 sq ft wood floor apartment on weekdays when I am at work. It can barely find its way home & runs out of battery power dying on the floor couple of times a month. Generates dust in the air that settles on everything although it appears to fill the dust storage drawer every day. Thinking my Home Depot rug is releasing rug dust daily. Noisier than I expected, not very smart, bumps & turns at random probably covers 90% of the floor in an hour & 50 minutes which appears to be run time when it does not get stuck & finds its way back to base. Ok for the price, as a single guy who does not clean much, keeps me from looking like a complete slob. Dust build up on electronic equipment & shiny furniture requires me to dust more often than I would, in fairness dusting ismuch easier than sweeping...

  This is our 2nd robot vac. Bought it Nov 2018 during Amazon Days. Glad I didn't pay full price. We used it on the main floor of our home but blocked off 2 rooms, leaving approximately 1,000 sq feet for it to vacuum. All but one room is hardwood with the one being carpet. Within 6 months we had to start propping it up to connect to the base to fully charge. At first used a small piece of cardboard. Around 6 months ago we upgraded to a small halloween mask we had laying around. Fast forward to last week when had to use a pair of fluffy socks stuffed under the bottom to angle it in such a way to make contact. Starting last week (Aug 2020, now owned for 21 months) it stopped making contact between unit and base no matter what we did, including sitting on floor holding the unit ON the base. It has officially died. When it ran, it did good. We have 2 short haired dogs and it always got their hair. We emptied the bin daily and kept the unit clean (which you must do often). Overall I would not recommend at its full price. But, if you're someone with a small home or apartment who can get this at a good price, it could be a good fit for you.

  When I called the company to request a replacement electrical cord for the 675, I was told they first needed the serial #. I found the serial # on the back of the docking station (which is what the missing cord was for), but they insisted they must have the serial # for the Roomba itself.It was a real pain having to remove the bin in order to locate this number. Not impossible, but so unnecessary. Why couldn't the serial # be located on the back of the machine? Alternatively, why wasn't the serial # of the docking station sufficient to get a replacement for a part that should have been included in the first place?

  Pros: I purchased the iRobot Roomba 675 Robot Vacuum to help keep up pet hair since my cat sheds so much. So far, I have been very satisfied with its work and the price I paid for it!  The cleaning schedule on the app is very convenient--just make sure your house is fairly picked up before running it.Cons: It would get stuck on things very easily, but it seemed to ""learn"" its way around the house with time, and now gets lost/stuck less frequently. It seems kind of loud to me, especially if you're trying to watch a movie or have a conversation with someone. However, you can schedule it to clean while you're at work, out of the house, etc.

  The quality and function of the unit was great and I would recommend it, if you don't have black in your carpet.We have an oriental rug that covers most of the living room and it has an elaborate pattern where the background is black. Whenever it was on that carpet it would get confused and signal that it ""was going to fall off a cliff"" and it would stop. I talked to their support and they said there was nothing that could be done. It is strange because we also have a black marble entry (with white flecks) and it didn't get confused there. I think it may have to do with the size of the completely black areas, which are and inch or two all over the carpet.Not all robots get confused, we now use a ""eufy BoostIQ RoboVac 11S"" and it does not get confused. Maybe it would fall off a cliff however, the house is a single story so we don't know.

It is learning so it is not hitting the furniture as hard but it still hits the dark furniture which leaves marks. I do notice that on the white baseboards it does not have an issue. It also has good suction power, so good that it pulled a shirt off the hanger on my lower rack. I would recommend that you pick up all the items off the floor (thick mats, slippers), scale, and the toilet paper stand as they confuse the machine.  Overall, I like it and will keep it because the scratches on the furniture are there already and it does a great job of getting up the dust from under the bed. One less thing for me to do!

The only thing I do is pick up Yute rugs that are a little thick and she might get stuck... The app sometimes does not work, but when it does, it is awesome! Absolutely love it!

  This little vacuum is loud and proud. It's got all of the top of the line features but has one major drawback. It's LOUD.  I mean nails on a chalkboard loud. If you released this into the world, it would have no natural enemies.

  Had it for 48 hours now, can't ever find its ""home"" dock... I have to hunt it down when it's dead and return it to the dock for charging manually, been clogged with stuff multiple times already, I have to sweep and pick up everything in it's path... literally a complete waste of time and money... it's more annoying than helpful... I will give away for free to whomever comes and picks it up! aughhh

  <U+00A0>I¡¯ve been wanting a roomba for years. I finally got one and it was worth every penny. I run it everyday because we have two pugs that shed a lot. It amazes me how much it picks up! It works with the amazon echo so you can give Alexa commands to start or stop the roomba. My only gripe is that when you tell it to dock it can sometimes take quite a while to find the dock and park.

  I hate vacuum cleaning and cleaning in general and Roomba is making my home soooo much cleaner. I have a slight allergy and I appreciate the fact that I can breathe better when there is less dust. I have Roomba clean our apartment every other day. I also love that it's possible to set up a schedule for it, so there is no need to turn it on even, it starts automatically.We have dark grey carpets and is perfectly capable to navigate those. It occasionally gets stuck, but it's not a big deal. It occasionally can't find it's home base which isn't a big deal either.The only thing that's annoying is cleaning the brushes from hair. I spend maybe half an hour doing that every 2 months or so, and nobody in our household has very long hair

  I bought this for my mother's birthday, because she hates sweeping the ground, but don't think this actually does the job. It cleans the same area over and over and over again, and misses huge chunks. It also dies 7/10 times mid-clean and is unable to make it back to the loading dock, and no one in my family (including the PhDs and engineers) can seem to figure out why. We've only used it about 10 times, but it often seems like too much of a hassle to use it because we have to monitor the direction it goes and then fetch it once it's done cleaning.

  I currently have three different types of tile in my house and it works on two out of three. The one it doesn¡¯t work on has a bunch of designs and is really rough- the other two are both smooth. I have three German shepherds and a cat so hair on the floor is pretty much a given.It picks up the hair okay but I¡¯ve noticed it doesn¡¯t have any kind of structure- Just cruises by in random directions. The fan behind it also blows the hair away when making turns.In certain parts of my house it gets stuck a lot and needs to be rescued. Usually if it gets on cords or between chair legs. It also only removes about half of the hair on the carpet (which I don¡¯t blame it cuz it¡¯s usually a lot of hair but keep that in mind if you have carpet and have pets that she¡¯d a ton).It works better if I lock it in a specific room while I¡¯m taking a shower or walking the dogs or making food. Otherwise, it leaves the area without finishing it.The trash storage space is kind of small so keep that in mind. I have to empty it out after it cleans each area. In all honesty, I¡¯m going to keep it because it does help my floors stay a bit tidier than before while still allowing me to do other things. I still have to sweep (but not as often) to make sure dirt or hair doesn¡¯t built up in the areas that it misses. Will I keep it? Yes. Would I buy it again if I know what I know now and I had the choice? No.

  I¡¯ve owned iRobot before and was extremely happy with my robot.  I think this time I got the robot that did not do well in school. I have rebooted and rebooted. It misses everything and then repeatedly vacuums the same place. I can move it out of the room it loves and it goes right back. Today, I had to go back through the whole house to vacuum after the horrible job the robot did this morning. I¡¯m not saving time and deeply not satisfied.

  These require cell service and Blue Tooth to operate. A lot of places don't get cell service, and where I want to use it at a mountain cabin is one of those. It's useless to me.

  Having owned a first edition Roomba back in the day, I was reticent to purchase another one but was intrigued by the newer features. I've had it for a week now and I am nothing but impressed. First of all, I can program it through the app on my phone. I currently have it set to start at 6 am each morning. It leaves its charging station dutifully each and every time. Then it roams around my house and cleans until it puts itself back to ""bed."" Most impressive is the amount of debris, hair, and fine dust it picks up every single day. I am truly shocked at how well it works, how little attention it needs from me (aside from emptying the dust bin each day), and how great my house looks! I am recommending this thing to all my friends!

  This may be a little on the expensive side but, in the long run it's a great investment. We moved in to a new house and having a border collie that sheds lots of hair we knew it was going to be challenging that's why we decided to purchase it.Pros:- It's great handling pet hair.- It will decrease the amount of manual work you have to put in cleaning the floor.- It's also great with other things like dirt or food crumbs.- You can start it without moving using the app or schedule cleaning jobs.Cons:-Sometimes it may take a while for her to return to the home base. We found out it was because the home base needs to be separate from other things so make sure you locate the home base somewhere that has lots of space.Overall 10/10.

  Just received it and plugged it in for an hour.. put it to work and away she goes. I think I'm going to love this little guy. It spends time over especially messy spots then leaves and goes somewhere else. Sometimes it comes back to ""make sure it got it all"" and I can't stop watching and following it! It even takes time to collect in corners. This stuff is Science Fiction. No more dust/hair/dirt under the edge of the bathroom counter etc. Under the bed dust.. gone. Kitchen crumbs at edges of floor.. gone. Specks of dirt on doorway area rug.. gone. Raise nap of carpeting.. back. I should have invested in it years ago. I'll update this review and rate it's features when I've used it for awhile.. but in the meantime I am thrilled!  Gotta think of a name as she deserves one.

  I have wanted an iRobot for a while now, but was very skeptical!  After much research, I went with the iRobot Roomba 675.  Needless to say, I am very pleased.  This unit vacuums my tongue and groove oak floors, moves to my carpet, and then tile with ease.  It also cleans my rugs very well with no problem!  I have been amazed each time i dump it at the hair, dirt and fine dust it has gotten from the floor!  If there is an extremely sandy spot, she will concentrate on that specifically!  The Roomba 675 is easy to use and can be set to vacuum at specific times throughout the day and week!  It runs for approximately 90-100 minutes and reruns to her charger.  We live in the country and have grown children and grandchildren in and out all the time, leaving my floors a sandy mess; Now, I just run my Roomba!  Great choice, great product!

I patiently let it charge for three hours as instructed. Then it ran for 90 minutes just like it said it would.

  I have a Roomba downstairs  and another one for upstairs, and I like them so well that I bought this one for a family member.  I don't use the timer or the Wi-Fi connectivity because I have a cat that's prone to coughing up nasty hairballs, and find that it's best to make a visual inspection of the area that is to be cleaned before setting the Roomba to work.  They do a fine job on hardwood, tile, and carpet, and make the transition from one type of surface to another without difficulty.  The only reason that I didn't give it a 5-star rating is that I have three oriental carpets that have rather large areas of black in the background and the Roomba won't go over the ""abyss"".

  On the up side, it does work well in terms of picking up the dirt.  I run it about every other day. It gets stuck on one low pile rug and shuts down every time so I have to manually move it off that one rug. So, I have to be home when it¡¯s running to help it when it gets stuck.  It does run on other lower piles rugs. The docking feature is worthless. It does find the station but when it moves up onto the platform, it just wiggles around and then sort of falls off the platform.  When it gets low on battery, it¡¯s supposed to find the docking station and shut itself down. This rarely happens. It usually just stops wherever it is and shuts down and I have to manually pick it up and place it on the dock.

  So I have it on schedule to clean the whole downstairs of my house every morning. And without fail, every day the dust bin comes back full. Where all that crap is coming from I don't know. Maybe it ducks out and goes clean the neighbor's house too?I've had 7 different floor robots and so far this one is my favorite. All previous robots I had were also wet-dusters/mopping robots. After a few weeks it became annoying to fill with water and rinse the mop, empty the vacuum etc. But this one takes 20 seconds to empty and put back to base, ready for a scheduled cleaning next morning.  And what's best is that it is powerful enough to clean the high carpeting too. My previous robots were not able to do that and got stuck.The reason why I am not giving it overall 5 stars is that it just does not return to base when battery dies. I guess it's like a hardworking donkey, works until the last breath. Luckily I can charge this baby up and send back to work the next day.

  I got this as a gift and I am very happy I didn't go buy one myself. Im constantly having to follow it and pick stuff up because it will pick anything up including my shoe laces so it can drag my shoes around till it gets stuck. It tells me it's stuck on a cliff at least once everytime even though I live on all one floor and it's really just stuck somewhere. Ig will go over the same room over and over and then finally go down the hallway and miss almost everything. Bought a new washer and had Styrofoam all over the hallway and it past it like 6 times before I finally had to vacuum it with another vacuum.

  Pro: the suction is very goodCons: the cleaning ¡°pattern¡± is totally random so it will never clean the entire floor area, even if you lock it into a 10¡¯x10¡¯ square room.It bangs into furniture like an excited pitbull pup. And it¡¯s almost like it seeks out places where it can cause damage and will go back to it nonstop.

  There are good things about this product.  It's powerful and can roll over most everything.  It does a deep cleaning (at least at the beginning).  Excellent for cat hair.BUT ... It is LOUD!  It gets clogged with debris/hair around the rollers and wheels.  I've cleaned this up many times.  I've become nearly an expert at vacuum repair.  However, as time goes on, it loses suction.  Unforgivable on our hardwood.  Still does better on the carpet.  It also knocks into things with a huge amount of force which could knock things over.  Also, the algorithm for it cleaning multiple rooms isn't very good.  Ours seems to have a preference for certain rooms with few obstacles and leaves rooms with obstacles with untouched areas (kitchen with island, dining room with table and chairs).  Jeez, this is where the mess is!

  Does a great job cleaning but...unbelievably noisy. Really. I normally have no problem working on line when a vacuum is running but the loud whining made being in the same room very difficult.  Also, wouldn't clean the kitchen unless physically carried there, and the kitchen was open floor plan and next to the docking station. We tried a complete reboot but it didn't work.  No modem in kitchen,  just standard appliances - no smart appliances  - and plenty of light. Easy to clean, good cleaning, but returned.

  <U+00A0>¡®Percy¡¯ is ideal for vacuuming under furniture such as beds, chest of drawers, tables and anything else that is tight to vacuum. A good feature is spot clean such as a rug where he starts in the center and works outwards in growing circles.Some other makes/models have 2 side spinning brushes which would be better than the 1 on this model. Sometimes he can get lost getting back to base because we have an open plan kitchen, living room, dining room. The only other downside is getting stuck on the edge of rugs.A great feature is avoiding stairs to the basement as it senses the ¡®cliff¡¯ edge.Overall a great purchase.

  Really wish I had bought one of these years ago.  It works great.  It does take a bit for the robot to learn your rooms and for you to learn where you want to go or not.  I also purchased the beam that keeps it from falling down the stairs and that has been a great addition.  I have a large house so I really only want bathrooms, kitchen, sitting room, dining room and living room cleaned.  I leave the bedrooms for different times.  You need to learn what the robot can or cannot get over and then pick that up as an obstacle. I let it go and it re-docks itself when it needs to charge.  Give it a couple of hours and send it out again.  My floors look really clean.  Truly like this robot as it makes it so I don't have to sweep or vacuum again.  Plus it gets all the cat hair from under things too,  It is great.  We named the robot Alice and absolutely LOVE Her!

  So I've been using this for a few weeks now and it's amazing with pet hair and everything else. My issue with it is the following which aren't really deal breakers but things that you should know before buying.1.Sometimes it doesn't dock well so it won't charge. So you'll find yourself a dead Roomba with half the job done or worse yet one that is docked and didn't start at all2. Even if you have the space for the dock as recommended if it's too far way... Let's say in a hallway it won't find it.3. If the wheels are wet it won't get enough traction to climb over small borders like a balcony rail. So those are tedious with wet floors.4. Storage capacity kinda sucks especially with alot of pet hair has to be emptied after every clean.5. Works with Alexa but it's not an instant response so let say you tell Alexa ""start Roomba"" Alexa will respond ""welcome to robot home for electric powered vaccumm like Brava.... Roomba... Something else, I can help you do things like ""start Roomba"" what will you like to do?"" Which is well annoying having to wait 15-16 seconds every time.6. When you set a schedule it doesn't send a notification if it started or not, I believe it does when it finishes.Other than this great product. More traction for the wheels would be nice. Oh and this will eat any cables laying around.

  I have had this vacuum for 6 mo.  At first it seemed to clean ok (not great).  I actually had a less expensive brand that amazon used to carry (150$) that I bought just to try the robot vacuum thing out.  I had it for a year it was an amazing cleaner! I would run it after I ran my big vacuum and it still picked enough stuff to fill it'shuge dust bin.  So I gave the older cheaper model to my son in order to buy a more expensive brand name version...BIG mistake! First the dust bin is tiny and I would have to empty it out at least twice during it's running cycle, when it was actually working.  The filter takes up too much room in the dust bin. It will run for almost two hours but leaves all kinds of stuff behind and I would have to come behind it with the big vacuum. So what is the point?? It ran for two hours this morning. I went to empty the dust bin after about 45 min. and the dust bin was EMPTY! It had not picked up anything.  Took all the brushes out and cleaned everything, tried it again. It was a bit better this time at least there was something to empty.  In my opinion the cheaper vacuum cleaned better at a year old than this one did brand new! I decided to write this because I am on Amazon looking for a replacement for this stupid thing after only six months!  It was a waist of money.

  First off, I am a neat freak/OCD, and I am always vacuuming my wood floors and area rugs.  My husband decided to rescue a Shepard, and my first thought was, ""are you friggen kidding me?!?!, I am going to die with all the dog hair.""  Literally, I was up all night thinking about the masses of dog hair everywhere. There was no arguing about his decision because we also rescued a Maltipoo 9 years ago, and he's been wanting a Sheppard.  Therefore, I  supported his decision because he's a great guy, and it helped that he gifted me Cartier love bracelets for my birthday - since  COVID ruined my 50th.  I digress.  ""Rambling Rose,"" the name we gave our Rhumba is a god-send! I have her scheduled every day to go on at 9 AM, and in about two hours, the entire house is hair-free.  She picks up mostly everything, but most importantly, she manages to get every last hair on the floor!  OUTSTANDING appliance and I will be gifting this number to several people this holiday season!!!

  We had an older model years ago, she lasted about five years before living in the home of people who rescue cats finally got  the better of her.  It's been quite a while since we had a robot and last year I bought a machine that was a different brand (Eufy)... that bot was stupid.. headed straight for places it would get stuck, every.single.time.I got this bot because..well, I wanted another one.She's been awesome.  First day was challenging - she kept finding the things that I missed (a cord ran under a couch, a sock drug under a chair by a cat, etc) but since then, she's been rocking it! The floors are clean.The robot vacuums will likely never replace a full-scale vac, but they are a great supplement.  I'm saving up to buy one for upstairs now.

  This was supposed to be an autonomous helper to assist in keeping my floors clean. The cleaning part actually works pretty well. The first thing I noticed was how loud it is for such a small device. You can't just let this guy run casually in the background; it will still freak out your baby and your pets like a regular vacuum. But beyond that it is not a time saver. I have to babysit this thing and end up spending more time getting it unstuck than if I just busted out the actual vacuum. I'm finally writing this review because it's inability to do the simple task of avoiding getting stuck has at long last broken my spirit. I want to cry. Every single time it gets stuck under the very middle of my bed and the wall. I can't reach it so I have to grab a broom to try and pull it free. This time even that didn't work. I had to take off my mattress and wrestle the Roomba free because of the useless dime-sized notch that inexplicably protrudes from the top of the device, begging to get stuck. I hate it, I hate it, I hate it! I'd sell it, but I don't want to burden anyone else with this toxic menace.

  <U+00A0>Ok.... So I¡¯ve literally only had it for a few hours lol and after set up it had enough battery power to clean and at least show me a little bit what it can do. I personally love it because it does what I wanted it to do which was pick up the cat hair that seems to be appearing even right after vacuuming and sweeping. No it does not deep clean as it can¡¯t fit into every crease and crevice of your house... so if you¡¯re looking for it to look like a maid just left your house then don¡¯t bother buying it. But if you would love some help keeping your house tidy but still having to sweep and or vacuum occasionally as it helps to keep the dust and cat hair down to a minimum, then I would say this is a yes for you. Knowing that it was coming today I didn¡¯t sweep because I wanted to see how much it could actually pick up and what it would possibly leave behind. Well as you can see a lot!!!!

  <U+00A0>I will start off by saying that the iRobot Roomba has definitely helped my family with the day-to-day cleanup.My wife and I recently welcomed A firstborn son into the family. In the beginning, it was a struggle to keep up with the household chores while one of us went to work and the other stayed home.  The baby did not like the loud vacuum we had, and taking the vacuum in and out each day was a big hassle, not to mention took one of us away from the baby.I purchased this product so that it could do the cleanup after feedings, and pick up the items that we might have missed. Out of the box it worked fantastically! Yes it runs around the room a bit randomly, but it¡¯s still gets the job done hugging the walls, and doing the different rooms that we have. The vacuum is decently quiet for what it is able to do, and on multiple occasions has not woken up our son when he is sleeping in the evening and for daily naps.This model does not have room recognition, so it will clean any area that you leave open. If you really want that level A vacuum where you can ask her to clean specific rooms, go with a newer model.The only issue that I have right now with the Roomba, is that It will not go onto our very short shag carpet. After contacting the iRobot team, they said none of their models would be able to clean a shag carpet. They suggested putting the Roomba onto the carpet to start, but that did not help.

  It's does what it should but in a very disorganized way. It kind of just bounces off of things from here to there in no determinable order. And it runs into everything...hard. If you have a glass of wine on a side table, it will run smack into that table and your wine will spill (which reminds me, I need to get some stemless wine glasses). I guess I was expecting more. I had a Hoover robot vacuum and the app to run it was terrible and after a year the whole thing stopped working completely BUT it would sense things and stop before running into it, and prior to first use, it ran a cycle and scanned your house for a map (we had to redo ours because it thought the dog was a piece of furniture and would never vacuum over that spot lol). You could see on the map where it went, and it had a very sensible back and forth pattern, similar to what you'd do with a regular vacuum. The Roomba just literally runs around like a chicken with its head cut off. Sometimes it gets my living room, other times all it does is the hallway before heading back to dock (and the battery is FULL). I'm hoping maybe it gets better the more runs it does but I've seen similar complaints. It's also pretty loud compared to my last one. The only pros compared to my previous one is that it is thinner and can easily fit under our couches and cabinets. It also can play a sound if you can't find it.  Needless to say, I'm a little disappointed because I expected more from this brand, for this price.

  This is a good product. It works silently and fast. The good thing is it can be operated remotely even if you are out of your house. The bad thing is that it remains in the room where it has been placed. If you want to clean up another room, the cleaner needs to be placed there. Also, it only partially removes the pet hair, and this feature needs to be improved.

  The vacuum did well on the floors and rugs although with technology as is there should be a way to turn off the sensors to go over black lines on carpet.  Live in a ranch, no stairs, should be an easy fix to turn off sensors but there isn't any, which makes this product only receiving 3 stars.

  Except for a couple of area rugs, there is no carpet in my house at all and the Roomba does a great job of picking up debris, as in grass that falls off my tennis shoes, dropped Fritos, etc., from my hard floors and rugs  The app downloaded to my phone works great.  The Roomba beeps if she is in trouble.  (I say ""she"" because we named her Cinderella.)  All in all, we are very pleased with her performance.A couple of minor complaints:  She seems to have a preference for some rooms over others.  She has worked the study to death and ignored a bedroom.  And a couple of times she seems to get lost and does not dock herself to recharge.  Both concerns are easy to fix by picking up the Roomba and moving her to the desired location. Doing so is still much easier than running a vacuum cleaner.I actually find it interesting to watch her work as she bounces and dances around the house vacuuming our floors.  I think of it as the Roomba Rhumba.  But then I have been self-quarantined for a long time..

  Doesn¡¯t pick up cat litter, etc along the edges of rugs which is of course the dirtiest part of the house. And most of the litter that¡¯s in the middle of the floor gets thrown towards said rug edges only to be left behind. I have to push all the crap far away from the rug edges before I run the thing. It does pick up cat hair off the rugs though. I can¡¯t run it when I¡¯m not home cause it¡¯s not accurate unless I¡¯m following behind it picking it up and putting it in different rooms. It¡¯s only a 920 sq foot single level house... It¡¯s still better than dragging out the heavy vacuum and fighting with cords so I would recommend getting one if your hopes aren¡¯t too high.

  This vacuum would be useful if it functioned as advertised, but in the 3 weeks I have used it, it has never sucessfully completed a job. The only thing it will do correctly is to charge its battery, but only if I place it on the charger after picking it up from where it tried to climb a wall and became stuck, or ran out of battery and expired 10 feet away from the charging station. One 18 X 22 carpeted room and one 15 X 18 tiled room is all it is required to clean. Every day I have scheduled it has been met with disappointment when I receive a message on the app that it has failed to complete the job due to becoming stuck or running until the battery has lost all power. If this is the future of robotics we are doomed as a species.

Another concern was noise.... it¡¯s not as load as I feared ! My upright vacuum upsets my dog but Randy doesn¡¯t she just watched him go. So 2 pluses in one evening!

I looked at the brush heads and they were completely clean. I cleaned them anyway, but got the error again five minutes later. Now I get the area every three minutes almost on the dot and the brush heads are sparkling clean, there's no way the error is accurate. The error wouldn't bother me if it was cleaning while I was out of the house, except until the error is rectified it just sits there on the floor, you can't even send it back to the dock.

Both large wheels, the small wheel, the brush and the sweep.  All have to be cleaned DURING use.  (You can see the circles of hair from the brush and sweep spindles.)  The detritus receptacle is large.  However, so is the very useful filter which inhabits nearly one half of the detritus receptacle.  This vacuum pinballs its way through a room.  There seems to be no charting a path for this vacuum.  However this vacuum is not an entire loss.  I do like the option to ""beep"" the vacuum to see where it resides.

  This is our second one of these and they just don¡¯t hold up.  It will last until just out of warranty and then things start to break.  The same stuff that was poorly designed on the older models is no better on the newer model.  The side rotator brush motor has plastic gears and they wear out quickly, which requires the entire module to be replaced ($40 or more).  The shaft of the side brush motor gets easily wrapped and filled with hair which is tough the clean out, contributing to the motor module breakage issue.  The shafts of the bottom brush and beater also get twisted up with hair and are a pain to clean off.  The thing gets hung up quite easily by furniture, edges of area rugs, refrigerator, etc.  I feel like we are constantly rescuing it from situations.  You can use the invisible barriers, which do work, but you¡¯ll need a bunch of them in an average home.  Eventually, you¡¯ll have nothing but barriers and only half of your floors actually getting cleaned.  There¡¯s got to be something better out there for the price.  We are moving on to try out another brand.

  We like Rudi The Roomba. He works very hard and does a great job cleaning multiple floors PLUS an outside deck. The biggest drawback is HE IS REALLY LOUD! I MEAN LIKE ANNOYS THE SH*T OUT OF YOUR LOUD SO YOU DON'T WANT TO BE IN THE SAME ROOM.There is a handy time function for your phone/iPad but if he starts up while we are in the room, we send him back to the docking station. That is somewhat amusing as it is if he doesn't know the way and must bump into lots of things trying to find his way back home. I'm former US Navy so reminds me of a late night in the Philippines watching guys trying to get back to the ship.  Typically we deploy Rudi on a floor where we don't plan to be for a few hours and let him have at it. He will go till he runs out of battery power and the floor/ carpet with be pretty clean. We will then dump the dust bin thingy in the trash and charge him up for the next floor.

  I have 4 pets, so I use this Roomba every day or every other day to keep my floors nice and clean. It works amazingly, however, I will say, if you have pets, maybe don't do scheduled cleanings. I made this mistake and my elderly dog was sick, had diarrhea all over the laundry room floor, next thing I know my Roomba went on his cleaning mission and lucky for me I was home and caught it in time, but if I wasn't home it would have been all over my house. Because of this, I know that the Roomba is very easy to take apart, and most parts can be soaked in soapy bleach water. FYI to other customers who might have this problem in the future, Q-tips work really well for this type of clean up. I have had my Roomba for about a week now, and if this little robot actually lasts for a few years, I will be a Roomba owner for life. I debated buying one for 3 years, and let me tell you, it was well worth the price. This particular model only has one drawback, it is rather loud from what my roommates say, but I'm hard of hearing so it doesn't bother me. I named mind Dobby because he's a wonderful little house elf.

  My 675 won't go onto dark rugs. I covered the sensors with tape but my house scrapes the tape off so the roomba gets stuck in the corner next to 10 feet of open burgundy colored carpet. If the tape stays on, the unit will work well.

  I purchased this IRobot after owning a Shark for 2 years-was looking for something quieter. I run one in the front of the house and one in the back.My iRobot has never found it¡¯s way home, get¡¯s stuck every time I use it. Does not pick up half the dirt my shark picks up and has scratched my wood floor just trying to dock.my Shark on the other hand, cleans the front and back of the house and makes it home 98% of the time, doesn¡¯t leave dirt behind. keeps up with hair from two cats and 2 dogs, and has never damaged the floor upon docking. By the way, they are both about the same lever of noice during operation.To top it off, if you want to keep your iRobot away from certain areas, forget the magnetic strips that so inexpensively accompany your shark and work great, you have to buy a separate devise and move it throughout the house to keep your iRobot out of tight spaces your Shark has had no problem navigating

  <U+00A0>I bought both the eufy and Roomba robot vacuums but I have to say I preferred the eufy brand. I did some research for many months on the type of robot vacuums to get and glad I went with eufy. Roomba is a very popular brand and there¡¯s a lot of rave about it but I honestly don¡¯t know why that is. It is super loud when cleaning and gets aggressive when it hits obstacles. It has a random motion like other robo vacs in the price range so I didn¡¯t see why it was much better than other robot vacuums. I also loved that my eufy came with a remote control which the Roomba doesn¡¯t and I find that handy if I want to quickly clean a particular spot. Here are the pros and cons to the Roomba but I¡¯ll go with eufy!PROS:-Since it¡¯s a popular brand, it¡¯s been known for its reliability.-Voice notifications from the robot-Easy to use app-I like the detailed cleaning notification on the app-Alexa enabled-You can click the home button from the robot itself. I didn¡¯t like that my eufy didn¡¯t have this function but luckily the newer model does.CONS:-Super loud!! Yes that is a huge turn off!-Bigger than eufy so makes it hard to go under furniture-Quite aggressive when cleaning..when it reaches obstacles it always wants to push through rather than go a different direction.In conclusion I prefer my eufy to Roomba.

  Every negative review is some sort of person expecting this machine to be incredibly intelligent and the greatest clean they have ever gotten. That's not what it's for.I work 12 hours a day. I don't like to vacuum and I maybe would do it once a week or two, just because i'm not trying to lug out the vacuum and do this with my day off. I have a cat and i wear shoes in the house, so it needs it. My girlfriend wants to be barefoot in the house but it was always kinda gross to do so.Now I have this robot. I have it scheduled to go at 12 every day besides the days I'm off. I get a message at around 130 that he is done. I get home and the floor is vacuumed. I walk barefoot in my house and it feels clean and looks clean. My house went from being vacuumed 30 minutes biweekly to an hour and a half daily and I do nothing.This is not a search and destroy missile. It's not the deepest clean your house will ever get. It is essentially an RC car with a vacuum on it that won't fall down the stairs and do an 8/10 job 7 days a week while you do stuff you actually want to do with your life.

  There wasn¡¯t much explanation on how the rumba works so the first time I used it I didn¡¯t think I would like it but the more I used it The more I liked it.  It does a great job of cleaning and it seems to learn the floor plan. It¡¯s a little noisy but you can live with it. I¡¯m house bound so I am always here. You can run it when you are not home.

  I read all the mixed reviews and really went back and forth about even needing a robot vacuum. I have an upright Dyson and a cordless Dyson and a 3 story home. I also have 4 dogs, teenagers and a full time job which leaves me very little time for shlepping vacuums around every day. After the reviews I was nervous because some people made it sound like an aimless wanderer that got stuck everywhere. My experience has been great, it took some experimenting and moving the hub to a different spot but I love it! I seriously feel like I hired a cleaning lady! Pros: 1. It picks up so much hair! I empty the canister and am always happy with the huge hair ball it produces. 2. It¡¯s so easy to use on my app. 3 Fits under all the furniture easily Cons: 1. It¡¯s not gong to get all of the hair when there is a rug that meets wood floor. It¡¯s a very small amount that it misses 3. It¡¯s too noisy to run while sleeping if you¡¯re a light sleeper... it bumps into stuff and while it¡¯s less noisy than a regular vacuum it¡¯s not super quiet either.My tips: put your chairs up before you clean and block off areas where it could stuck with a blanket ! My dogs go to their kennels when I have it on and I block that area off because they hate it and it bumps their kennels.

  It has to be babysat every time I use it. We have concrete floor with a few area rugs, but doesn¡¯t do a good job. It can¡¯t get itself out a small area. It can get in that small area, but then it just keeps going back and forth hitting the wall, and  the couch; only changing directions slightly. It never figures how to get out. I have to pause it, pick it up and now it somewhere else. When I either send it home with the app or push the dock button it doesn¡¯t go back to the dock. I have to pick it up and put it right in front of the base then hit dock. Beyond Frustrating! And now it¡¯s too late to return it!!!

  We bought 2 Roombas about 6 months ago to clean 2 separate floors in our house, and it was a challenge from the start. It's gone downhill since. This review will describe the product in the first weeks and recent month.1. First weeks. They did a good job of picking up pet hair (2 large dogs) and child crumbs and filth. I liked how they can ""dig"" around chair feet to grab hair that was stuck to the chair feet. But they were LOUD. So loud that they could not be used unless we were out of the house or put on headphones. They weren't very ""smart"" in that they didn't seem to cover ground efficiently, but they ""usually"" got the job done. I say usually, because as often as not, they wouldn't find the base, or they would have trouble docking and couldn't charge. The base is so light that when the vacuum tries to dock, the base just spins around with it. It helps to put a rug underneath if you're on hardwood, but this is not foolproof. Sometimes, they would get lost and didn't make it back to base at all, so I often had to play ""find the Roombas"" with the kids. The Roombas missed charging often enough that I didn't even bother trying to set up the programed features, so I can make no comments about the programs. Still, my house was more clean, so I dealt with the noise and charging hassle without too much annoyance.2. Recent month or so. As I said, it's gone downhill. Neither Roomba charges at all without some intervention on my part. As you can see from the photos, one must have a very heavy stone weight placed at a certain location to the right in order to charge. The second one must have a lift from underneath. Even with these interventions, neither Roomba charges fully, ever. The one with the cardboard underneath only runs for about 20 minutes before dying in a random location. The one with the heavy weight runs about 40 minutes before death. Well short of the 90 minute run time they claim. In turn, my house isn't clean, and the fur piles are starting to accumulate.Based on the very short life span of these devices, a 1-star rating is in order. I am currently browsing for other robot vacuum options.

The spinner is stuck again and even after cleaning it thoroughly it isn¡¯t working. This thing is too pricey and I haven¡¯t had it two months.

  Overall, a waste of money.  I thought my vacuuming days were going to be reduced, but not so.  Think of the Rumba as a weak dust buster on wheels.

  I'm definitely liking it (Wall-E) so far. He has drastically reduced the amount of dust and dog hair in my home. He is a bit noisy but I run him in the evening time right before I go to bed. I set up a schedule on the app and haven't got used to the time because I do get startled for a second when he comes on. I haven't ran him while away yet because he did get stuck a couple times. I do recommend decluttering your areas before starting a cleaning. I tend to pull out dining room chairs and pick up larger items like shoes first. I do have to remember to empty the bin before the next cleaning though. I also do notice that I have to sweep still in areas like under cabinets where he doesn't have enough clearance but not enough to not use him. The setup was super easy. I did have to figure out where the best place to put the dock as I didn't have enough clearance in the spot I originally was going to put him. He does tend to repeat certain areas but I try to ignore him and let him do his thang. Oh and my dog is not quite sure what to make of him and is annoyed with having to find a new laying spot when Wall-E comes around. But glad he's not barking at it otherwise I'd have to find a new home for the dog..lol jk

It more often than not stops in the middle of the floor and you hear the message ""please charge Roomba"".  Have moved the docking station a couple of times trying to find a more centralized area but only marginally improved docking success.  Never once did my Evovac fail to dock.  The dirt collection bin also cannot be washed because the electronic wall sensor is in that bin and washing it would damage or destroy it so all you can do is wipe the inside with a damp cloth.  Poor design IMHO because there are nooks & crannies in the bin you just can't clean.  Today, the Roomba stopped in the middle of the floor and no message at all.  All the app said was it had lost connection to the cloud.  Put it on the charger and it wouldn't charge at all.  So here's the one really good thing.  I called tech support and they were able to walk me thru some troubleshooting.  Took it all apart,  cleaned it,  removed and replaced the battery and was finally able to get it to light up and start charging.  The agent was very competent, thorough,  and pleasant to deal with so 5 stars for customer support.  3 Stars for all else.

  Roomba confirmed that this product will not work with 5 G networks which ATT is in process of upgrading to. If I bought this and they upgraded tomorrow, I would have a useless Robot. Roomba should have disclosed that with a sub window or something before the purchase. When I asked for a replacement they informed me that it was not 250.00 like the one I bought.  It is 500.00 !!! They have 2 models that will  work with either network.  I spent 2.5 hours between phone time and failed installation and I am not happy and feel deceived. If you intend to buy any robot ask these questions.

  This machine seems to be OK, tho it follows an erratic path and so did not clean part of my rug (which really needed it).  But one of the reasons I got it was that it was reported to be quiet.  It is not - it is VERY noisy.  I hope there is something I can do about this b/c it is very heavy and I don't want to deal w/ having to return it.  But it did a decent job since we haven't vacuumed in months and we have two cats.

  This is the worst robot vacuum I have ever owned. It is not intuitive. It get stuck on every small bump on the floor. It routinely decides to no longer charge once docked. Even when it is working, it sucks up very little. You can literally watch it pass over the same crumb over and over. This is not worth your money. Shark brand has been the most reputable brand I¡¯ve owned thus far.

  Its definitely a great vaccum for daily cleaning, especially if you have a shedding dog. Not so great for deep cleaning or picking up.

Im a clean freak but I¡¯m also 30 weeks pregnant so I can¡¯t clean as much as I want to without having a sore back. I run the roomba almost every day and it really maintains the house in between ¡°real¡± cleans. This version doesn¡¯t learn your house so you have to be patient with it because it will go over the same spot a thousand times and maybe do things that don¡¯t make sense lol. Because it doesn¡¯t map out your house, it takes longer because it relies on bumping into things to get around. Mine always gets stuck in the sliding door rail even though the doors are closed and sucks up charger cables if left dangling on the floor so just watch out for those little things.

  I really wanted to love this vacuum, but it¡¯s just not worth the money. It¡¯s obviously ideal for homes without children or messes because it just can¡¯t handle them at all. On day two, my roomba couldn¡¯t dock itself. It¡¯s docking capabilities come and go, but the machine requires so much regular maintenance. I¡¯d say it charges itself maybe 75% of the time. Unless I follow it around the entire time, it will find a way to get stuck. It¡¯s so frustrating watching it roll right over a piece of cereal or some dirt to inevitably get itself stuck on the edge of a rug or on the threshold between rooms. Save your money and buy a real vacuum. Trust me.

  I recently moved into a new 2-story home with wood laminate downstairs (carpet upstairs) and didn't want to bring my vacuum up and down the stairs to clean both areas. I decided to keep my vacuum upstairs and bit the bullet and bought a Roomba for downstairs. My downstairs area is quite small (approx. 650 sq. ft.) but I have a decent amount of furniture so it is not what I would call an ""easy clean."" I also have a dog and a cat who shed A LOT, and as any pet owner know, hair finds its way into every crevice possible. So far my Roomba has done an amazing job picking up pet hair and dirt downstairs. It easily cleans the floor and rugs and seems to get ""smarter"" with each use navigating around furniture/obstacles. It runs for close to two hours (until the battery runs low) then docks itself back at the charging station. The app is awesome and allows you to schedule cleaning times/days so you can start the cleaning mode while you're at work or away from home.

  I really wanted this Roomba to work for me and unfortunately there were too many negatives. First it wouldn't vaccum the area rug, which is beige but has a black 1/2"" wide trim border. I found out that the clif sensors often mistake black edges for cliffs. Sure enough, I covered the sensors (there's no stair access for the roomba on my main level) and it would go on the carpets! But it did an awful job. Literally driving over the top of visible dog and cat hair and not picking it up. Needless to say, not what I was hoping for. The final straw of my 1 week trial with it was when it died in the middle of the hallway for the SECOND time, instead of returning to base when it's battery was low. I emailed tech support and they informed me that my main level being 1200 sq ft is too much for a roomba that doesn't have the mapping software, and I would have to buy a virtual wall to keep it within 600 square feet so it didn't get so far from the base station and die. Needless to say, that is not going to work for me, as I can buy a model with mapping for the cost of this roomba plus a virtual wall.

  For being the go-to brand name in robot vacuums, I am disappointed in this. I have used other brands in this price point that do a better job. This model is loud, clunky, and doesn't clean up all that well. It only has one side brush where others have 2 for greater effect. It has a high profile so it gets stuck under furniture a lot.

  This is a very help tool, it cleans well and has good battery. It cleans my entire down floor and lasts around 2 hours. It does tile and carpet really well, and transfers between them easily. It picks up hair very well but it tangled up in the brushes and was very difficult to clean. Also one brush is rubber and the hair cut through it and damaged the rubber brush pretty good. It's easily disassembled to clean and easy to empty the bin. My only real problem is that hair is extremely difficult to clean out of the brush and the rubber isn't very durable to the hair cutting through it.

  This product works has a vacuum cleaner just fine but don't be fooled by some of the tech hype.  The vacuum easily gets stuck under items, after three days it's gotten stuck under the corner of my couch, under the lip of the dish washer and under one of my coffee tables. I had block block off there areas to keep thing moving.  For the returning home when done part:  I tries to return home when the battery gets low; but it has no idea where home is unless it's within about 6 FT and has direct line of sight.  The cleaning pattern is random, nothing at all intelligent about it.  If your trying to clean more then one room on a single level and the robot is a room separate from the docking station it's won't find before the battery dies.

  I didn¡¯t think this thing would actually do a thorough job, but wow we absolutely love it. We have 4 dogs (short hair), a cat and a guinea pig so we really put it to the test. She¡¯s gotten stuck a few times on kitchen mats that had pulls in them so now I pick the mats up or kick them to the side at least so she can get around.

  Easy to program and use. The app works well. Picked up a good amount of dust and dog hair from the hard wood floors.On the negative side it got stuck several times at the edge of the steps and it got stuck constantly / daily under our dressers and end tables. I had measured the height underneath and the height of the Roomba but yet it still wedges itself under the front edge of dresser even tho the Roomba is 1/4"" taller. Kinda dives under at an angle then grinds its tires trying escape. You literally have to wiggle and pull to get it unstuck.After several months we gave up and bought a thinner competitors model and moved this Roomba to the first floor. Now it has a new list of negative habits... it gets stuck daily on one of the thin throw rugs. If it doesn't ball it up underneath then it simply won't traverse the edge. Many times it gets onto the rug then will not drive itself off the edge back onto the hardwood.Very very disappointing because it does a decent job of picking up dust dirt and dog hair when it is actually running but unfortunately it is stuck more often than it runs.Our older model Roomba without WiFi and edge sensors did a much better job of not getting stuck and completing a cleaning cycle.The competitors model purchased for the upstairs is half as loud, fits under most of our furniture, runs much more smoothly with less bumping into objects and has a longer runtime. We will probably purchase another Eufy in the future. Especially with the price difference.Update... Added a pic of how easily it gets stuck.

  I like that this sweeper picks up a LOT of debris. It has made a big difference in my apartment. I have two complaints.  First, this vacuum has the poorest suction in the iRobot lineup. Their higher end vacuums have a device inside that creates additional suction, which this unit does not have. So, basically, it's a glorified sweeper. That said, it picks up an amazing amount of debris, dust and hair. It's not a replacement for a pet vac, but it sure helps! I do not even have pets. My second complaint is that the Alexa support does not apply to the Amazon Fire 7 tablet. That's right - you will not be running the iRobot Home app from an Amazon tablet, unless you sideload some things first. I have an issue with software apps that only support a few select devices.

  We got a Roomba and have been amazed by how well it performs, so we got this 675 as a gift for a neighbor with a small child who had helped us out during the current stay at home period. They had wanted one but had been hesitant to spend the money to try one out. They have loved the 675 - they set up the wifi, plugged it in, and zoom this thing was going around the floors zipping up mounds of fluff they didn't even know was there. Can't say enough about how easy these things are to use and to clean, and how well they vacuum. Well worth the money for the quality of product you're getting.

  First of all, it won't dock.  I've done everything the websites and app tell me to do and have even called only to be told - ""sometimes they just won't dock.""  It never docked, not one single time.  Straight out of the box, it would not dock.I returned it and am waiting on my refund.  The thing wedged itself under one particular piece of furniture repeatedly.  I've put things in in place to block the roomba, but for some reason it is obsessed with getting wedged under this cabinet.  It will relentlessly pound against whatever is blocking until it has moved it out of the way so it can go halfway under and stay there.  I can tap it with my toe to make it change directions, but oh no, it's going to get under this particular piece of furniture each and every time.  The top of the roomba is scratched from having to be forcibly removed from it's confinement.It also never picked up much of anything.  Just not a good purchase.I can't believe how much money I spent on this absolute garbage.  So disappointed.

  This is a terrible vacuum if you have dogs, we have two, have carpet, and want to have clean floors. No matter how many times a day I ran this thing it never did a good job. If I want clean carpets I have to manually vacuum therefore defeating the purpose of having a robot vacuum.*I run this vacuum everyday and also do the regular cleaning maintenance*After 7 months of having this product it started giving me the 14 error code which is an issue with the dust bin. I contacted Roomba and they sent a new bin.The error has started back up again (6 months after the last replacement) and now even Roomba¡¯s at home remedies aren¡¯t working. I was told by Roomba customer service that my one year warranty was up and that I needed to buy a new bin. I spent the $40 on a new bin and it¡¯s still throwing the 14 error. Needless to say I¡¯m sending the new bin back since that didn¡¯t remedy the issue and finding a different robot vacuum brand!I can¡¯t begin to describe how disappointed I am that this vacuum only lasted 14 months. I had expected it to be much longer.

  For someone with bad back, with a pet who's shedding and a neat freak, this has got to be the best purchase and investment I've made. Seeing my floors/place clean everyday, this robot cleaning under my bed, and under hard to reach places (with regular vacuum) is very satisfying. We also have hooked it up with our ALEXA device, so we can voice command it, plus the app gives up an update when it is stuck somewhere, and we can also operate it with our smart phone device, it literally feels like we have a robot maid.

I run her everyday and everyday her little basket is full!  I've heard some people say they don't like how she goes from room to room without finishing in one room. She is amazing to remember where she's been, and if I run her everyday eventually she is picking up every little thing in every little space! She sweeps over the throw rugs beautifully! She goes in and out of the kitchen chairs wonderfully! She cleans under the beds like there is no tomorrow! She goes under couches and chairs, gets all those places that are hard to reach! She just gets stuck every now and then on a register, under a table, at the top of the stairs, and she needs your assistance. She runs for about 2 and 1/2 hours before she takes her little self back to the dock and charges up again!  She's easy to clean and wipe off! Going forward I cannot imagine life without her!

  OK. I am in an interesting position where I can compare 2 of these vacuums. I previously owned a Deebot N79. It ran for about 3 years with a battery change last year. It finally stopped charging even with a new battery. So I bought a Roomba... Ok, I have 2 small, husky type dogs that blow their coat every 6 months, a cat, and laminate floors with a couple of fluffy door mats. The house is open plan but has quite a bit of furniture to negotiate. So both vacuums had the same task. The Deebot was better.1. The Roomba only has a single front brush. So bits tend to get flipped across the floor. Also when it circles, it circles on the brush side, which seems counter-intuitive2. The Roomba is noisier, quite a bit loader.3. The Roomba moves faster, tends to overrun dirt rather than always picking it up4. The Roomba sits higher. Pros and cons for this. It doesn't get stuck so often under cabinet overhangs, especially the kitchen.5. Finally, the fuzzy logic/AI that creates the 'random' path that the machine tracks around the house means the Roomba doesn't cover the whole house. This was the most frustrating part. I would have to keep relocating it to a part of the house it hadn't covered because it would become 'obsessed' with a specific part of the house. When the machine had bashed your ankles for the 5th time in the kitchen yet hadn't even got into the front room, its just irritating.Both machines would run for about 2 hours on a full charge. Both would need regular emptying, especially in shedding season. But the Deebot did a better job of cleaning and covered more area. These are both older models so it interesting to see how a newer version would cope. Also, I never used the wifi connectivity, which was available on both. I was happy to press the button when needed. But I do appreciate having a robot vacuum, very useful.

  Love it! Living in a house with 4 dogs this Roomba was something I always wanted & its been an absolute blessing.  Happy Mothers Day to me!  Roomba, aka Suzy runs every night as scheduled. Its been a life saver & my tile floors have never been so clean. I'm amazed at the amount of dog hair that is in the dump bin.  The first few days the Roomba ran 2 to 3 times a day, every time catching massive amounts of dog hair.  Dry dog food will send her back to the dock. Due to the amount of sand & dirt brought in by the dogs. I clean the brushes almost daily. Its an easy & quick task.  I use a damp paper towel & old toothbrush to keep my new friend nice & clean, wiping down the wheels & around the dump bin.  Maybe a little too OCD,its just a little spit bath.

  I¡¯ve researched On Amazon before buying this one and selected this model because I thought I would be able to setup the rooms and areas on the phone but I guess this version do not have this feature so it would be the same as buying any other cheaper model that uses remote control. The machine is really dumb, goes hitting everywhere until it finds an open area to clean, it does not clean everywhere, it keeps going to the same places and leave others dirty. So really no point in having it if I still need to go vacuum myself. Also, since it keeps hitting all the walls, it¡¯s hurting all the trims in the house, leaving black marks everywhere and white marks on the machine. Not worth to have something that doesn¡¯t clean and in the long run will make us repaint or replace all trims. Maybe if the machine had rubber material around wouldn¡¯t hurt the walls as much.

  I seriously love this little vacuum. I live in a 1000ish sqft apartment with mostly linoleum floors. I also have 2 cats and because of my allergies, I use silica cat litter. Anyone else who uses silica litter probably knows, stepping on a single piece isn't fun. Also, the amount of fur around my apartment was ludicrous. This vacuum helps so much. It doesn't have a huge capacity wastebin, but, for my apartment, it is plenty; provided I empty it after it runs. I have it linked with an iRobot account and my Alexa, and I love the expanded features, like being able to start it from anywhere in my apartment. I haven't tried to schedule it yet, I'm not sure how well that would work considering one of my cats likes to try and start it, and he knocks it slightly off the base. (As of yet, he hasn't figured out the button starts it, but I'm sure that is only a matter of time.) I check the robot every morning to make sure it is charging and run it in the mid-afternoon, when the cats are napping and unlikely to mess with it. I have to say, I run this every day, and I am constantly surprised at how much it actually picks up every single day. I didn't know how much dirt gets tracked into my apartment until I bought this vacuum.My one complaint, is that the front wheel gets a lot of fur stuck in it. While this doesn't affect the running of the vacuum, it is one of those little things that bugs me and is surprisingly hard to clean out.The one feature I would love to see tho, is a locator. Like a little beep you can activate if it gets stuck under the couch or bed, or something similar.

  Rosie the Roomba does a great job picking up my hair (which is very long) as well as my two cats' hair. Much easier to just prep the house (pick up loose things on the floor, move some furniture around) and start Rosie than to vacuum--which forces my teenager to pick up her room! Also helped us take control of the flea problem we were having. Connects to the app and lets you know when she's stuck, low on battery, or done with the job (and she returns to her dock to recharge). Easy to empty bin (just remember to do it every time as it's not very big). Very happy we finally got her!

  This vacuum's a glitchy mess. It requires constant baby-sitting and doesn't save any time.Half the time, it can't dock by itself. It just runs until the battery runs out, and depending on your house/apartment, it might be hard to find and rescue. Manually docking it is really annoying: it needs to be positioned extremely precisely or it won't charge.When it does dock automatically, it usually doesn't charge. I have to wiggle it around for 1-2 minutes until it starts charging. The scheduling feature in the app is pretty useless since I have to do everything myself anyway.There are problems while it's vacuuming too: it often gets stuck, it often gets clogged, it bumps into things violently. Sometimes it gets stuck on nothing. It often yells ERROR 23452345 CHECK THE APP. But there's nothing in the app.There are even problems while it's docked and should be doing absolutely nothing. Sometimes it randomly starts vacuuming in the middle of the night. Sometimes it randomly yells ERROR.The app is poorly designed. You know how you can schedule repeating alarms on iPhones and Androids? And you can disable those schedules without deleting them completely? Seems like a no-brainer, but the Roomba app doesn't let you do that--you can only delete schedules.Definitely do not get this if you have pets. If a pet poops or vomits, the Roomba will smear it everywhere. The manufacturer's official solution is that you should inspect ""floor conditions"" every time you vacuum. So it's yet another task you need to perform yourself. Even if you can get past the ""poopocalypse"" problem, there are plenty more. If a pet slightly bumps into the Roomba, it just starts vacuuming.There are many other issues when the Roomba works ""correctly."" It's loud and it takes 1-2 hours to vacuum. No using the phone for 1-2 hours then. It requires frequent brush cleanings--much more than a regular upright vacuum. It will sometimes randomly ignore some rooms. Very unreliable.

  This roomba is ok for cleaning hair and it does take dirt out when you take the qaste out you can see that it cleaned. However, this model skips spots. They say that it maps out your house and knows where to go and how to clean, but what it does is just goes in all directions randomly and hits everything and gets stuck. It ends up missing spots on hardwood floors. It needs 1.5-2h to finish cleaning and I live in 1 bedroom apt. I expected much better performance.

  I bought this Roomba 675 when it was on sale on Amazon for $200 back in January. It¡¯s a ¡°manual¡± model (no fancy home-mapping feature), which was just right for finding out whether or not this concept would work for us. It didn¡¯t hurt that it was recommended by The Wirecutter.After running it on manual over the first weekend, I set up a Monday - Wednesday <U+2013> Friday schedule. By Wednesday of week one, I noticed that the dirt cup was completely full every time, so I expanded the schedule to every day of the week except Sunday.For the balance of week one through Monday of week two, the dirt cup continued to be full at the end of the run. On Tuesday and Wednesday of this week, the dirt cup was less than half full on both days, so I reverted back to the MWF schedule. The dirt cup was only about a third full after it ran on Friday.It looks like we¡¯re finally getting caught up with cleaning the floors downstairs after about a week and a half of running the Roomba almost every day. If the amount of dirt in the cup continues to go down next week, I may cut back to a twice a week schedule.So far, I¡¯m perfectly happy with this model, even if I do occasionally have to get it unstuck or help it find its way back to its charging station before it runs out of battery power. Our downstairs floor is cleaner than it¡¯s been since right after we moved in over two years ago. I don¡¯t think that we need either the whole-house mapping or self-emptying features of the more-expensive models.I have no illusions about never having to use our upright vacuum cleaner again, as the carpets and rugs will need periodic deep cleaning, and there will always be places that the Roomba won¡¯t be able to get to. Manually emptying the dirt cup after each run gives me useful feedback on the efficacy of the current schedule, as well as giving me the opportunity to vacuum off the dirt filter each time (to extend the useful life past he recommended 1 month).Note that I work from home, so I¡¯m here to keep an ear on the Roomba while it¡¯s moving around the house. As it gets stuck about once every time it runs, I¡¯d definitely say that YMMV if you¡¯re planning on running it when you¡¯re not at home (and depending on how many ¡°robot traps¡± you have).I have noticed that how long it can work depends on where its random path algorithm takes it. The more time it spends on carpeted areas, the shorter the run time<U+2014>about 70 minutes if it¡¯s staying on carpet, compared to about 80+ minutes on tile or wood flooring.Installing the iRobot Home phone app was a big help, both for the initial setup and for controlling the Roomba. It also generates push notifications if the Roomba gets stuck or confused and needs assistance to resume cleaning.

  Another disappointing product. I bought it to save my back. I have to follow it around and use my feet to get guide it in the direction I want it to go. It seems to go in random directions. It does not pick up pet hair, it just leaves it in clumps for me to pick up. It is ok for getting other easy dirt up, but I have to follow it, as I said above.  It has a hard time docking itself, I have to help it. Huge waste of money.

  This has got to be a case of a company degrading their product via firmware updates.  This iRobot worked perfectly when we first got it.  Before an update about a year ago, it would always clean in a zig-zag motion, since one of the firmware updates it constantly wants to do circles.  I have checked all the sensors, cleaned the unit thoroughly, it is something in the firmware that they changed the pattern.  Please IROBOT if you are viewing this change it back to the zig-zag pattern, the circle pattern DOES NOT WORK.  It is consistently getting stuck in corners and smaller areas now.  I do not recommend an IROBOT product, buyer beware!  If they fix this problem in the next firmware I may change my rating.  Please let others know if they have the same issue.

  Good things are the manufacturing quality and ease of app use to control vacuum. Negatives are more significant and include very limited dustbin, requiring 3 empties during 1 house cleaning for decent performance, poor dog hair pickup, and frequently cannot find its home.

  The squeaker! It worked great for last month up until a week ago, it started making this horrible loud squeaking noise when cleaning and the brush on the front will stop spinning after about five minutes of cleaning. My husband took the brush off and cleaned the pet hair and debree from around it, but this is only a temporary fix until the next time it turns on to clean, where it does it again!! I expected far more from an Irobot vacuum, as i have owned a Deebot vacuum before and it didn¡¯t have any problems at all for the first year i had it. It was quieter too. This vacuum is very loud before it started squeaking on top of the motor noise! Not super happy with this for the price.. i am going to request a new spinner brush for the front and if that doesn¡¯t help with the problem, i am unsure what my next course of action will be.

  Great for the money. Well worth it. I got it so I would have help cleaning up dog hair off my laminate floors. It has done that and more.

It does appear to work extremely randomly but I have yet to notice it missing any spots. So whatever gets the job done. I would recommend running it at least once a week while you¡¯re at home in case it gets stuck or you want to make sure it only gets certain areas. Oh and make sure you tidy before you.

Sometimes I want to clean a place more than once, or if for some reason Romba turned the other direction, i can easily turn it back. Currently this is not possible. It is very annoying to have to get up each time to get Romba back to the place I want it to clean.Nevertheless Romba is amazing and does a really good job.

  I did a lot of research and was so excited for this!  However, after one day it was returned.1) It didn't pic up the simplest dirt.  I watched it go over areas multiple times and there were still specks of dirt (both on carpet and hard wood).  Yes it picked up dust under the couch, but all the visible dirt was still there.  And we don't have a super dirty house - just two of us no pets no kids2) It's very loud, louder even than my normal vacuum.  Add to that it's always running into things to add to the noise and it drove me nuts.  You'd never be able to run this while sleeping or even watching tv3) It's zip zag random dumb motion - it goes in the most non-sensical motions!  It got stuck under the couch about 3 times, but totally ignored parts of our room.  It went from room to room constantly4) This random pattern means it took forever to clean! I could vacuum myself in a tiny amount of time it took the roombaFor a $300 vacuum I would expect to not have to babysit it and clean up after it.

  <U+00A0>I own three tabby cats and one husky dog, all of whom shed an insane amount of fur. I'm also highly allergic to all of them in addition to suffering from seasonal and dust allergies. (Benefits of pet ownership > my sinuses, apparently.)My house is also quite large. I mainly use it on the main floor, which has a very large and open family room, dining room, kitchen, front entryway, bathroom, and back door area. I also move the Roomba to my upstairs floor to clean the bedrooms. All rooms have hardwood floors with a few area or entry rugs. Prior to owning the Roomba, if I wanted fur-free floors I had to vacuum at least twice a week while wearing a filter mask to avoid sinus infections. I was so exhausted of the upkeep.I was worried that the Roomba wouldn't be able to keep up with the amount of fur in my house and/or would struggle with the transition between rugs and hardwood, but I decided to risk the expense. I'm so glad I did and wish I had bought one years ago!!!!The Roomba is an excellent option for keeping up with daily pet fur and small messes on hardwood floors and carpet. I set it to clean once a day on my main floor, and two or three times a week I carry it upstairs to clean. Every evening I use my large, upright vacuum to vacuum out the Roomba's canister and filter, which takes about a minute's worth of time. Check out my photo to see how much it picks up on my main floor every day! At least once a week I inspect the bottom of the Roomba to check the brushes. Sometimes I remove the brushes and pull or cut out out any stuck threads or fur.It takes about an hour and a half each day to complete its job on my main floor and usually returns to the home base to charge again without issue. If the house is particularly messy I let it charge and run it a second time, but I don't usually need to do this. Sometimes it misses small sections of floor, but since I run it every day it usually hits everywhere at least every other day.One small complaint I have is that when the Roomba moves off a carpeted area or rug and onto the hardwood floor, sometimes it leaves small chunks of fur that must have been caught underneath it. (See my second photo and video.) Considering how amazing a job it does on a daily basis on keeping the hardwood floors fur-free and what my upkeep used to be I'm not going to complain too much about this inconvenience, but I hope that the engineers at Roomba find a way to improve their product over time. Maybe the suction power needs to be increased?The Roomba has greatly reduced my need to do frequent vacuuming and now I can get away with a deep clean vacuum job once every other week. It has been a mental health and sinus saver and I'm so glad I bought it!

  This is a very basic robot-vacuum cleaner, in that it does not map the room/house but does adhoc zig-zag cleaning every time you turn it on. It's battery is not very long. For our 2 bedroom apartment, it would die out after doing the living room and one bedroom - and it wouldn't resume after that. I had to manually take it to the 2nd bedroom and have it clean that, which is a pain. Some times it would clean the same room twice (because it doesn't know it has gone there before).I guess I should have done more research on the different variants of roomba before buying this. This is one is suitable for only small 1 room type apartments which can be cleaned in one shot. I finally ended up returning this one and going for an advanced model, which was twice the cost but maps the rooms first and has a pause, recharge and resume feature - which I think should be present in all models.

  I wasn't expecting too much out of a ""bump into the walls"" vacuum cleaner.  But, the Roomba is fascinating to watch.  It has some clever algorithms that goes all around the house without getting hung up.  It easily transitions from hardwood floors to carpet to slightly raised tile floors.  It doesn't seem to overdo an area either, it seems to hit pretty much everywhere it can get into.  The little sweeper wand looked cheesy but works quite well.We have two short hair shedding dogs that get hair everywhere.  The Roomba fills up pretty quickly in about 30 minutes.  I can see the luxury of having a self emptying container as well as a geo fence model to focus on specific areas but that may be a future purchase.  For now, we are quite pleased and amazed at the 675.Recommended!

  If your room is anything more than a 10ft square with little to no furniture don't bother with this vacuum. I've had it for about 4 months now and I've tried my best to ""make it work"" but I'm fed up with it.My chief complaint is it gets stuck ALL the time. The ""cliff detection"" sensors get tripped up by blue coloring on our rugs. If, by some miracle, it happens to get on top of the rug it has a bad habit of going directly to the other side and being trapped in the 1ft gap between the rug and the wall.Not only is this tripped up by a rug, but God forbid you own stools or some other chair that is smaller than a la-z-boy. The damn thing can get itself stuck just fine, but can't seem to figure out how the eff to get out from it's newfound prison.Two stars because the build quality is fine, I'm feeling generous.Just burn your money and you'll have less pain than owning this thing. If you want a decent robovac go for one of the LiDAR bots with a mapping and virtual wall feature. I've had one for a little while now and have booted my Roomba up to the attic. Fun fact, it still gets stuck even though it's a basically square room.UPDATE (July 20, 2020): My Roomba now cannot detect when it is hurtling itself off of a ledge and after 2 minutes of ""cleaning"" the attic it will try and hurl itself down the stairs. Within 10 minutes of starting a clean it quits, having YET AGAIN thrown one wheel off of the staircase.DO NOT BUY THIS. IT IS A WASTE OF MONEY.

  I dreamed of owning a Roomba since I first saw one. Finally, I decided I would trade the suction and cleaning power of a real vacuum for the convenience of the Roomba. Unfortunately, it's the most useless piece of garbage on Earth. It cannot even finish a cleaning cycle.Oh, don't get me wrong. It often thinks it does. Because it's useless. Right now it thinks it has finished the job, because it's done most of my bedroom. The rest of the apartment is up to me, I suppose.This may be because of how difficult it is for the Roomba to actually do any cleaning. Originally, the plan was that I could take the dog for walks while Roomba cleans. But that's not possible because about every 90 seconds I need to move it. Roomba thinks it's near a cliff. It's not. Usually it's just sitting on hardwood floor. One time there was a small, half centimeter bump in the rug. That was Kilimanjaro to this useless robot.Now, you may be thinking ""I'm sure his cleaning needs are much more than mine."" Oh, but they're probably not. I have a 700 square foot apartment with no steps, and only a small carpet and one rug. Roomba still can't clean my place.Reluctantly, I gave my dream purchase one star. I gave it a second star because if the geniuses behind iRobot are any indication, we will never have to worry about robots taking over the world.UPDATE: I've included photos of things that are too difficult for Roomba to handle. Both of these Roomba could not handle as it was ""near a cliff"" requiring me to manual move it. The former you can clearly see the MASSIVE drop off from the rug to the floor. The second, it's difficult to tell because, yes, it looks perfectly flat, but that's deceiving. There's a slight bump in the rug!! Honestly I don't understand how I don't trip over it constantly. No vacuum, particularly not one that I paid a not insignificant sum for, could possibly handle a slight bump in a rug. I've limited the photos to two of the - no exaggeration - THIRTEEN times Roomba encountered an error on this one area rug and I have to pick it up, move it, and restart. What a great purchase! Thanks, iRobot!

  Decided to splurge on a name brand roomba and take advantage of the amazon monthly payments option. Huge mistake. I¡¯m still paying on a roomba that doesn¡¯t work.

  Impressed for my first robotic vacuum. It does a pretty decent job vacuuming. I have hardwood floors and it tends to blow some of the dog hair around at first but eventually gets most of it. Not impressed with the front cliff sensor. If it goes at my stairs head on I will get the cliff warning and have to move the Roomba. But if it goes towards the stairs at an angle the side cliff sensors work great.This unit doesn't have do virtual mapping so it will run around, sometimes vacuuming a spot 5 or 6 times. It will continue cleaning until the dust bin is full (generally an hour and a half). I do wish it did virtual mapping so it wouldn't have to run so long each time but, doing the barefoot test afterwards I can tell that it did it's job.Overall for my first robotic vacuum I'm definitely happy with it. I can honestly see myself eventually upgrading to the unit that dumps the dust bin automatically. Not immediately but that will definitely be my next robotic vacuum purchase when I decide to upgrade.

  <U+00A0>Not a fake review. I bought a Roomba maybe 10 or 15 years ago. Wasn¡¯t impressed. Tried again with this model. Really pleased. As long as you make sure there aren¡¯t wires or cat toy strings, it does a really good job. Even under furniture. It¡¯s a bit loud (but not as loud as a regular vacuum) to I try to time it for when I¡¯m on another floor or not home. When I check the filter bin I¡¯m impressed with how much it collects. I think mine can run for an hour or so, which is sufficient for the full floor. I don¡¯t use the app much but it does alert me when it¡¯s stuck or has caught something like a string from sweatpants under the bed. And as you can see from the video, my cat is intrigued by it. :)

  BOTTOM LINE: My floors have never been cleaner. As a busy young professional I simply cannot compete with something that will vacuum for 90 minutes per day, every single day.  For that reason I will likely be a lifelong customer of robot vacuums, most likely this brand.That being said, this device is not without issues.  The primary thing that I run into is that it gets stuck 90% of the time.  That's fine with me, and this point I just expect it, and then move it when I get home.  It will get stuck behind a couch, it will get stuck on staircases, it will get stuck if it runs over a shirt.  The other major problem is that it won't necessarily clean the entire house it'll just clean a certain area and think it's done.  If it goes into a room and then manages the shut the door of that room, then it will vacuum that area and then stop.  There's no map in this version so it just mindlessly roams and sometimes that's just in a smaller space.The last thing that I wish was different, was the loud ""ROOMBA STUCK"" announcement at 3am, if you forgot to re-dock the vacuum. Or, if the Roomba decides it's not placed optimally on the charging station, the vacuum will turn on and then move around a bit until its in a better spot (again in the middle of the night).All of that being said, this just feels like we are in the beginning stages of an excellent technology. My house is clean, and thats why I bought this.

  It's a good product and does what it claims to do.Pros:- Controlled on the app or on device- One can put it on an schedule- It does well knowing where stairs are and won't go off the edgeCons:- If you have any black or darker colored area rugs THIS IS NOT THE PRODUCT FOR YOU, unless you want to pick them up before each vacuuming. The sensor that makes this product ""smart"" at detecting extra dirty areas is also the sensor that makes it automatically shut off if it encounters a ledge. And because my area rug is black, it thinks it's about to fall into a black hole and shuts off.- Compared to a cheaper competitor's product, the Roomba costs about $100 more and does the same quality job. There's no ""better"" that comes with the extra $100 that you would expect.- This Roomba is a BRUTE. It's very ""heavy handed"" and hits things quite hard before it changes course. The cheaper product I owned by one of the iRobot competitors was much more gentle with walls/barriers.- All robot vacuums are loud but this Roomba is a little louder than others. Maybe it's because of power of the engine that smashes it into things so hard?OVERALL: Good quality product that is made well and works well. But for the price you can get a competitor's product for significantly less and it'll perform as well as this Roomba model. I'm sure there are higher end Roomba models so my review is SPECIFICALLY based on the Roomba 675.

We had to be with it almost constantly to remove items from its path and, sometimes had to pick it up to avoid them.  This is our bad, not a problem with the machine.  We certainly would recommend it to anyone that has wide open spaces for it to roam about in.

  An Amazing Product. I have owned this unit for a year. We had an issue at the beginning but customer service took immediate care and replaced the faulty part. ""Dusty"" affectionately called, is the best investment I have ever made. We have 2000 sq ft of hardwood and lot of furniture and rugs and this unit just keeps everything neat. It is not a deep clean. With two cats i no longer see fur balls everywhere. ""Dusty"" does txt you when his bin is full...which happens often.One of those items in life that actually does make your life easier.

  This 675 is our third and newest Roomba.  All do a good job; the oldest had a more limited battery.  Battery problem is solved here.  Cleaning is excellent.  However, this 675 takes at least ten minutes to empty and clean out.  Hair and dust clumps get caught around the brushes in the brush rollers and have to be picked out, tediously.  The other Roombas we have use rubber rollers that are much easier to clean and can be cleaned in a couple of minutes.  Since we clean the Roombas every time we use them, the caught hair in this one makes it our least favorite.

  This is the best invention created so far in the cleaning department. I bought it for my mom for Mother¡¯s Day and she loves it. At first it starts to get to know the premises so at first it will bump into furniture but not too hard to cause any damage to furniture nor the vacuum. It¡¯s just getting to know it¡¯s way around your home. But afterwards, it does it¡¯s own trip around the house. Don¡¯t expect too much for the first 3 cleans since it¡¯s new to your house. Just like how we would get lost in a place we don¡¯t know. Afterwards it¡¯s so good and super interesting to see it going around doing your chore.

  Love it so far. Was skeptical at first so we got this model, the cheapest. We have a husky German shepherd mix that sheds so much fur it¡¯s not even funny. I love vacuuming but really don¡¯t want to do it everyday. Luckily this roomba also leaves the vacuuming lines which I was worried about not having as trivial as that sounds. It¡¯s the most relaxing thing to be doing something else and having your house vacuumed for you, it¡¯s vacuumed more in 2 days than my husband has in our marriage!

  I was really skeptical about buying this because of all the reviews that I'd read. Mind you, I've only had it a few weeks but have used it almost daily, if not every other day. #1: THIS DOES NOT REPLACE A HUMAN USING A VACUUM CLEANER. You will still have to deep clean once in a while. #2: this does a perfectly adequate job for dust, dander and pet hair. Seriously, I love setting my Roomba up for a mid-day clean when I'm not home and coming home to a hairless floor. Of course, there are some spots that the roomba can't reach, but for a family home with 3 dogs- I'd buy this thing three times over. Very happy with this little guy. Two thumbs way up.

  I was excited to try my 600 series out only to find that I spent more time making sure it did not get confused than I would actually grabbing a vaccum cleaner.  While this unit does its job (kind of) it has yet to ever be able to find its base and eventually just dies.  I have blocked off portions of the house, gated certain rooms, closed all the doors - yet still this thing has zero clue how to get back to the base to re-charge.  Completely regret the purchase for something I thought had more automation and much less need for babysitting.  Do not make the same mistake I did - do your research =(

  It was on sale and our anniversary so I went ahead and purchased it. After doing some research I landed on Roomba for couple different reasons.  First, it's the original robot vacuum company. Then I factored in availability of replacement parts, ease of maintenance and existing reviews.That being said I'm so glad I bought this little god send and so far I'm very happy. Out of the box it cleans sporadically but I think it's starting to get better. I only purchased it to clean the wood floors/area rugs on our middle level. This area has the highest traffic between us, our 2 kids and our 2 cats.We were sweeping every other day and constantly had little pieces of dirt on our feet, so I thought let's give it a shot. This vacuum is not perfect but the floors have never been cleaner. It's not very loud and has a very decent battery life. We schedule it to clean in the middle of the night while everyone is asleep. It only got stuck 1 time because a robe belt got tangled in the brushes. We are very happy with our Roomba and look forward to it cleaning for us every day! The only reason I knocked 1 star off is because the 3 prong sweeper was torn after 3 cleaning cycles. I know these parts are changeable but hopefully this was just a fluke. I wonder what the v9 series is like considering how awesome the 675 is!

Hysterical if you're watching, not so fun if you are actually battling the robot. Anyway after messing with it until the wee hours of the night... I sent the little jerk back and ordered this one. I really wish more people would have stated how easy this little gem is to set up! Took me 10 minutes!!!! If anyone out there is NOT a techie, this one is for you!I sent it to work and I thought I lost it under the couch, but it was okay, I'm hoping I dont have to keep emptying it as often once it gets all the hard to reach places.

  Overall I¡¯m satisfied with the unit. The only fault it has it won¡¯t vacuum my shaggy rug on top of the carpet. Which isn¡¯t a dealbreaker. I have a large coffee table covering most of it. I do have a hand and shop vac. Thanks to COVID-19 I was able to afford a luxury I didn¡¯t know I needed.  It goes over the carpet several times. I can watch tv while its running. It doesn¡¯t scare the rabbit into hiding. I do wished it came with two sweeping arms. But that is just me thinking of more efficiency. I like you can name it and program for auto cleaning.

  I decided to purchase one of these after I was sick of all the cat hair on my wood floors/having to vacuum multiple times a day only for dust and hair to stick to my socks. Once this guy arrived, I was ready to rock n roll. I turned the vacuum on and an hour later my floors were the cleanest I¡¯ve seen. There definitely  a random pattern but he seems to clean most of not all of the floor which is way better than the manual vacuum.I docked points for suction power because although it does clean well, it only works best with dust and hair. Mr. Burns ran over an ATM receipt and drug it around instead of sucking it up.All in all I am VERY pleased , my floors have never been cleaner. Now all I need is the robo mop and I¡¯m set!-ps: I named him Mr. Burns soi can activate him by telling Alexa to ¡°release the hounds¡±Update: this is not for rooms with precious furniture, mr burns doesn¡¯t seem to be able tell when a dark colored object is is in front of it resulting in chips in my sofa leg.

  The product does a decent enough job as far as vacuuming is concerned.  The app worked well and paired with the robot easily.  It's mapping doesn't seem very efficient, missing the same spots time after time.  I noticed that it would run over it's own home base during every clean cycle and the unit would simply stop in the middle of whatever it was doing after about an hour and a half.  When asked to dock, the unit either wouldn't, or it would roll over to the home base, run it over, then take off in a random direction.I talked to iRobot support, which was incredibly helpful.  They responded by email quickly and walked me through as many steps as possible to resolve the issue.  They then requested a phone call, which was quick and very helpful.  They used a neat streaming feature to watch what the unit would do when asked to dock.  Without much hassle, they sent me a new base unit very quickly (1 or 2 days later).  Unfortunately, the problem continued unchanged, even after performing a factory reset.Given that my concern seems pretty common, and issues like the inefficient mapping (if it was mapping the room at all, given that it would run over it's own base), I decided to return the unit to purchase a different one from another reputable company.I've used iRobot Roombas before, but they were all older units.  When I'm in the market for a higher end model, I would definitely consider another iRobot, but I can't recommend this one.  +1 star for excellent customer support.

I also close bathroom doors as my bathrooms are so small it managed to close the door and got stuck inside. I have lots of animal hair, 3 cats, 1 dog. Yes, it has to be emptied every time. But with that amount of hair I would expect it. I also recommend having an extra filter. Then when you wash the filter you have one to use. I use this every day even if I don¡¯t feel I need it. Keeps the hair under control.  Just like everything you have to learn the Robot but it is so worth it. I still do a deep vacuum about every 6 weeks but Furby does maintenance and I love it.

I thought this AI crap was supposed to ""learn"".I'm not kidding, this unit has wedged itself nearly irretrievable in the same areas multiple times (such as behind my toilet).  It even ceases operation to send me a notification that it is stuck.  You'd think such events would lead to .... learning.  But no.  This thing is dumber than a kid on three pounds of pixie sticks and keeps making the same mistake.But ... when it does happen to be in the vicinity of dirt, hair, etc., it does a *reasonably good* job fulfilling its purpose.

  I made sure to clean up with my manual vacuum before running the Roomba 675. On the first day I ran the Roomba 675 the side brush lost one of its brushes.. My entire house is tile.After setting up the schedule it ran for a couple more days at 9am every morning.  it did well with picking up the dog hair but clogged before it finished. Overall aside from the side brush breaking off which completes the deep corner  cleaning, it is a great little vacuum. I will have to order more side brushes if they are going to continue to break off against my walls.

  I'm a single person that runs this twice a week and I clean the filter, wheels & brushes regularly. After 16 months, the motor just quit. I have it programmed to run and the app will say it's cleaning for about three minutes and then it will time out. All the while, the Roomba never came off the dock. It is fully charged and I can hear the chiming that it's going to start cleaning...and then...nothing. Contacted the Customer Service email that Amazon provides...hoping to get a satisfactory resolution. I will update this review to let potential buyers know of the service recovery experience from this company!

  We have hardwood throughout the home (single story) with two area rugs (one in a bedroom and one in the living room). It has about 45 min run time and does a good job. May want to run it twice a day for larger homes. It¡¯s kind of loud, so not ideal to run while watching television or talking on the phone. Recommend  to be emptied every other day. Also, be sure to pick up anything that can get caught in it, such as phone chargers, cat/dog toys, etc. it can be temperamental with certain colors of a rug as it will think it¡¯s ¡°on a cliff.¡± Make sure you have the charging device set flat against the wall for it to dock and charge.Overall, this is a convenient product. You will still need to vacuum/sweep as it does not get *every* spot, but it does a good job of maintaining a tedious job.

  So after a year and a half the charger stopped connecting to the Roomba and it was completely dead, but I called iRobot's customer support and the rep very easily walked me through a few steps to resolve the issue and promised me a call back in a few hours once the vacuum would have had a chance to charge. Ultimately not giving 5 stars, because this troubleshoot steps should have been in the manual to save the aggravation, and because the vacuum's height keeps getting stuck in a few places in the apartment under furniture which makes it a drag to find and put it back in the dock.

  I have been waffling back and forth for some time about getting a robot vacuum. Haven't had much luck with corded stand up vacs, so my husband and I caved to get the Roomba. I had high hopes, and after reading all the reviews, thought I had finally made a good decision in getting this product. The first day we had it and everyday since, it has needed a LOT of attention. We are very busy and the Roomba was supposed to help us clean our very messy dog-haired floors to ease us up from having to clean it constantly. This vacuum requires constant attention because it keeps getting ""stuck near a cliff"" WHEN THERE ARE NO CLIFFS AROUND. We live in a one floor duplex and it constantly gets stuck and we have to intervene. Constantly. Another thing about it is it will clean the same spot for 10 minutes, forgetting the rest of the floor. It doesn't have any sort of path and never gets everything. It's very annoying and frustrating considering what this robo vac is supposed to do. I don't recommend it. Just stick with a stand up vac and do it yourself. It takes less time and is a lot more thorough.

  The product is easy to use, helps reduce the amount of crumbs and pet hair on floors and carpet between deep cleanings. The compartment that holds the dirt and dust is relatively small, we have to empty it out during use. We have pets and I have long hair, which gets wrapped around the brush, so you have to take it apart to remove the hair. It transitions well between hard floors and carpet. It doesn¡¯t clean in a pattern, so it misses spots and goes over the same spot several times.

  I got the iRobot so that I could clean underneath my beds without having to move them.  It has more than fulfilled that need!  I have cleaned one room per day since I got it and while it's running, I can do other things.  Needless to say, my regular vacuum is a lot faster and more efficient, but I have to move everything in order to really do a good job so it doesn't get done often. I like the ease with which this iRobot was set up and ready to go.  I'm puzzled by how it establishes the pattern it chooses to use but it cleans the whole  room then tells you to move it so I can't complain.  The battery holds up well.  Overall, I'm delighted with what I call my new old lady toy!

  Very easy to set up and use (I didn't download the app). It is loud and in bumps into things with some force, but hasn't caused any damage to furniture that I've noticed. I did have a loose piece of quarter round on the baseboard in my kitchen and it pushed it completely off, but was an easy fix. It does bump around pretty randomly, but gets the job done. You do have to pick things up before you run it, but if you like clean floors and have kids and/pets, go ahead and buy it. It's not perfect but it's better than spending time sweeping and vacuuming! Better for using when you are out of the house (I had planned on running it at night, but even in a 2 story house it's too loud and kept waking me up). Overall, I'm happy with my purchase and do recommend.

  I was excited to buy a roomba vacuum because I hate vacuuming and also hate per fur tumbleweeds in my apartment. I was disappointed with the Roomba 675 model. After one job, I had to stop it half-way through to disentangle both my long hair and my cat's hair from the bristle brushes, because it had gotten so wound up it wouldn't work. If you're a single person living alone in a small apartment with no long hair or pet hair floating around, it may be a good option. But for almost everyone else, especially if you're specifically getting a roomba because you have a pet, I would recommend upgrading at least to the E5, which has silicone brushes and doesn't get stuck and tangled like this one. Luckily I returned my Roomba and was able to buy the upgraded model, which I am exceedingly happy with.

  I purchased this item after reading mostly positive reviews. I used it for only two cleanings and returned it since it didn't work for my needs. I have a short-haired dog who sheds enough that two to three cleanings at minimum per week are needed to maintain my home. I should clarify that I wasn't looking for a vacuum to do the entire job of cleaning my home. I just wanted one that could  help me maintain between my  deeper cleanings. This vacuum mostly pushed fur balls around, which were ultimately cleaned only when I swept by hand. I did rate this product more than one star because it picked up some sand and dirt on my hardwood floors without problems. It also picked up dirt and sand from some shaggy and flat area rugs. This model is not an expensive vacuum, so the cleaning pattern was random, and spots were missed. From what I've read, Roomba's higher-end models have a more consistent cleaning pattern and might do a better job. After my experience, I now wonder if the buyer is paying more for the brand than for the actual quality of the item. I will continue looking for other options.

  I ordered this completely understanding that I would not get the robot equivalent of me sweeping and vacuuming every other day. I'm obnoxiously dedicated to a tidy, dirt free home. That being said, I am VERY impressed! It is quieter than a normal vacuum but not so quiet that I would run it in the middle of the night. I have two skittish cats who seem mostly unbothered by it which is surprising since they are usually scared of everything.Pros:It cleans up daily dirt and debris from normal foot traffic and my careless teenager.It sucks up the stray litter that normally gets tracked all over the houseIt fits under most tables and furniture vacuuming areas I rarely have time to get to - including under my bed!It handles the marble lip of my bathroom doorway like a champ and can handle 1"" lifts and drops without much fussThe spin brush pulls dirt away from corners and baseboards into the vacuum. Much more efficient and clean than I expected.The app and sounds make management a breeze. I set roomba to run every day at 2pm and roomba texts me if anything goes wrong or when it needs help.Cons:It does not like my dark grey rug. It will do the edges but not much more and the narrow area between the carpet and wall confuses the sensor and roomba will shout out that it's stuck even though it isn't.It can be a bit too thorough at times. I have roughly 900 sq ft of space that we have roomba set to vacuumn and it spends 2+ hours vacuuming over and over until the battery is almost dead. Not complaining! But if you are trying to do a larger space it may die before it gets the job done.Which leads me to my next point - roomba has a hard time getting back on its docking station. I don't know if I need to move it or if there is a way to secure the station to the floor but almost daily when the roomba returns to dock it bumps the docking station and can't connect so it will then go back out and roam around for 20 more minutes trying to find the docking station again. It makes no sense. The battery occasionally dies because of this and I have to pick it up wherever it dies and bring it back. Again, for the time saved it's not a big deal but definitely a design flaw that could easily be remedied.Overall I love the product. Even with the cons, I can live with only having to vacuum our rugs occasionally and something else doing all the rest. This is the first time in years I've been able to walk barefoot in my house without dirt getting all over the bottom of my feet. I used to spend 3-5 hours every weekend caring for the floors and cleaning up our home. After roomba I spent less than 20 minutes on the floors and had time to tackle projects I never have time for! Totally recommend! Already told my husband I want the roomba with mop abilities in a few years.

  I have 4 dogs and being at quarantined at home all the time made me acutely aware of just how much hair and fur was floating around the house in between weekend cleanups.Therefore, I decided to purchase this Roomba to mitigate some of that problem. And let me tell you, this was one of the best purchases I¡¯ve made all year. I used to spend about 2 hours every Saturday just vacuuming. Our Roomba, whom we¡¯ve named Eugene, has cut that time down to 20 minutes. The Roomba can¡¯t always get sharp corners, which we seem to have a lot of in the house. So, if you¡¯re buying a Roomba to stop hand-vacuuming completely, you¡¯re going to be disappointed. But, as an aid to the house, The Roomba has revolutionized my household¡¯s cleanliness.Furthermore, I¡¯ve been running it everyday since it arrived and it¡¯s only gotten stuck once on a dog toy. I¡¯ve added emptying it every day to my afternoon routine, but it usually only needs it every other day. It does get some hair stuck along the inside cleaning rod but I just comb it out once every 5-7 days and voila, all good again.TLDR: Roomba is awesome if you just need help keeping a clean house, but it might not completely replace a normal vacuum.

  If you want a bull in a china shop, this thing is for you. Gets hung up on thin rugs, loud as a normal vacuum, doesn¡¯t stop sucking up chords, slams into everything, and last but not least, utilizes the same route over and over again. There are way better brands out there that are equivalent in cost, quieter, do a better job, aren¡¯t the size of a VCR and have a remote so you can control the vacuum when the horse gets out of the barn. Eufy is one of them. I¡¯ll be sending this back, and from the looks of it, Roomba will offer no support in the process. If you are serious about a iRobot Roomba and have the budget, get one that maps rooms and can be controlled remotely when it decides to wreak havoc.

  I had a hard time sifting thru these reviews. This is my first time owning a ¡°¡±robot vacuum¡± and I am very satisfied. It boils down to this...we just bought a home with dark hard wood floors. They are beautiful but after a week I discovered they show EVERYTHING! Ugh. I was sweeping every day or two and having twin toddlers at home that just wasn¡¯t sustainable for me. Now with running my Roomba every other day or so I only have to sweep and mop every 1.5-2 weeks. Big improvement! I¡¯m a happy camper.  I have included pictures of my rugs I have at home. It has no trouble with two out of three of them. One is a high pile so I expected it would have trouble with it. All in all  it gets in all the little corners, even under my furniture.

  We have a blind dog and so far, from two cleanings, I am pretty sure if we attached a vaccuum to him and let him wander around the house, it would probably be a lot like watching the roomba work.  Lots of seeming aimlessness and bumping into things.  The roomba is also kind of loud.  Not unpleasantly so but is louder than I imagined.  And so far, during both cleanings the roomba has gotten caught up on the legs of our recliner which is apparently what it imagines hanging off a cliff to be like because that is the error message I get.  Now.  Let me tell you why you should ignore all that and buy this anyway.Now, I don't want to overstate this but basically, 'The Tiger King' on Netflix changed our life.  Our 13 year old daughter just randomly now blames EVERYTHING on Carole Baskin.  So, when we got the Roomba, she was DELIGHTED to know we could name it.  Guess what she named it? Yep.  Now, ""...that b*tch, Carole Baskin"" doesn't fit in the spaces allowed so we did have to settle for ""Carole Baskin"".  This name was chosen because we have four cats and ""Carole""  just goes around cleaning up cat hair.This is important because when you setup your Roomba, you need to download an app so you can schedule, name and manage your Roomba.  When your Roomba gets ""caught up on a cliff"" like recliner legs in our case, your app will alert you that your Roomba requires assistance.

Please relocate Carole Baskin...""My daughter HOWLS over this.At this point, being in quarantine and in a home that takes that VERY seriously, if this thing did not work for crap, I would still give it a 5 star rating. The hilarity and entertainment is just worth the money at this point, honestly.However, that being said, ""Carole"" works AMAZINGLY well.  As I said, four cats across approximately 1,500 sq. ft. of our first floor (of a 2 story home) 24-7 is a lot to keep up with and I routinely feel overwhelmed by the upkeep.  Our floors are SO clean!

However, lately our Roomba has not been working properly. The sweeper will doesn't spin, and now it won't keep a charge.  We like this vacuum at first, but just doesn't seem to last very long.

  So, I love my Roomba!  It saves me precious time and energy.  We have an Akita and she has long, thick dark hair.  When she is shedding, I run the vacuum every other day at least.  Her hair sometimes gets caught in the brush spinners and I have to take them out to clean them.  That's my only gripe about this machine.  I also wish it were faster, but I guess that's going to happen later.  One good thing about the vacuum is that it will go under your beds where, let's face it, none of us can reach.  It gets all the dust bunnies that like to hide under there.

  We really like our Roomba as it does the intermediate spot treatment throughout the week when we don't have time to clean up dog and cat hair.Our biggest problem with Roomba after having it for a year now is returning to the home base after a job. We have the base in a very accessible spot and for some reason it either takes 20+ tries to take the 2-foot path home or it runs out of battery while this attempt goes on. Even when the Roomba makes it back to the dock, it seems that the pins under the Roomba do not align well with the dock and the Roomba will back up and start the docking process all over again. The pads on both ends are clean and the surface is level so not sure what that is about.

  We have had 3 Robot vacuum cleaners now. We use them daily and have hardwood/ carpet combo. The previous models were Deebot N79s and they actually worked really well. We were excited to ¡°upgrade to the Roomba when getting a unit for another floor,¡± but honestly the Roomba is much noisier, does not pick up as many crumbs and debris with only 1 side brush(very frustrating), and rams into our baseboards and furniture like an oaf causing notice damage over time. I personally think this is a very competitive space and you can get a much better vacuum for less money if you don¡¯t have to buy the Roomba name. Maybe their more expensive models are better, but this thing side by side to competitors is terrible. Battery life does seem to be better than others on Roomba though.

This product seems to have some hiccups. It works don't get me wrong, and I definitely still appreciate the floors being clean. However, it might take it awhile to get there. I do not feel like our whole house is ever clean. It will go in circles quite often and clean the same areas frequently. It does not deal well with my long female hair nor the pet hair. They seem to get wrapped in every crevice. The battery life is not as good as our previous one. It also does not find its dock well and errors out more than I would like. I am very disappointed and would send it back if I could. Especially for the price, our last robot was ~$149 and far superior. I am giving this an average rating because perhaps if I had never had a better one, I would not know the difference.

  Use  - Hardwood & vinyl floors  | 1 cat & dog | 6 rooms approxOverall -  While we have to clean out the Roomba after each use and sometimes reset it on its base, having the Roomba has drastically helped keep our floors maintained. Instead of every day, we now personally sweep once a week and let Roomba run daily.Pros - picks up dog hair, removable/replaceable parts make cleaning less of a hassle. can traverse minor obstacles, (dog toys, rugs,cords)Cons - base is lightweight and sometimes gets pushed around when Roomba is trying to ""return home""  and the floor needs to be very flat otherwise it may not chargeOther comments - there are metal prongs that connect the trash bin to the device. These need to be cleaned each time you empty it otherwise it may cause an ""error"" and Roomba will not run. 7/10 this has been the issue of roomba not working properly. a minor fix saves a lot of timeThoughts - It would be great if the base could be better set to uneven surfaces to make sure the metal charging pads touch the machine uninterrupted. *Older house so finding an even wood floor surface is not easy.

  Of the cheap robot vacuums I've owned this is the worst one. It is actually starting to fill me with anger whenever I have to deal with it, which is constant.I had an early Neato vacuum years and years ago, pet editon since I have two cats. It did its job, it was super simple, it couldn't go under my kitchen rolly-counter but it could get over the lip into my bathroom, it almost always made it back to its base unless it found a forgotten sock or loose wire. It had a mildly annoying beep if it was stuck but not incessent. It had shitty battery life though and eventually it died altogether.Then I bought one put out briefly by Anker, of course it had great battery, that was never a problem. It could fit under my kitchen cart, it ocassionally got stuck trying to get into my bathroom but usually it worked its way out of problems, it may have beeped once or twice when it first got into trouble but then would stay quiet. It usually made its way back to the base, but if not it had such great battery life that it didn't actually need the base for a couple days. Anker stopped selling them though and while I think they're probably the same as the eufy ones? but I wasn't surewhen I broke my Anker while cleaning it (completely my fault) I thought I would try Roomba. I mean, roomba is the big brand and should be better. While this is a cheaper roomba it is more expensive than my earlier robot vacuums.Why I hate it- It is loud as hell, but doesn't do any better job- it gets stuck on the lip into my bathroom every time where the others were able to go in and clean that room- it can't get under the kitchen cart, it also gets stuck on my desk and another thing in my office because of that wierd little outcropping it has on top- when it gets stuck somewhere, or can't find the base, or is low on battery, or is sitting on its base but not charging it both tells me via text message and LOUD voice message - the voice message repeats LOUDLY every now and again, like in the middle of the night.- It finds the dock every 3rd or 4th time it runs. I live in NY, my apartment is not big. The dock is in a very central place, the other vacuums had no problems with their docks in that spot.- On the rare occasion that it can find its dock It often fails to charge because it can't get its finicky self onto the charger correctly, my other vacuums just backed up and re-docked. I think I might be able to fix this by taping the dock to the floor, but that wasn't necessary with the other vacuums- it has shit for battery life. Yesterday it started up on schedule but I turned it off because I was in the middle of something, but it didn't redock ... it wasn't doing anything, there was nothing that should have drained its batteries, but today it is dead.- The neato used a pattern to clean, the Anker bumbled around at random, both always managed to hit my whole apartment. The roomba I have to keep carrying into my living room, from which it constantly returns back into my hall without cleaning the living room. I have to barricade the sucker into the living room to get it to clear the largest room I have. The other robots had no issues whatsoever with this, I don't even understand how it is an issue.The good?The app works really well with it, impressively so. I did have trouble initially connecting to the Amazon Echo, there was some sort of server error, but whatever the issue was they'd fixed it when I tried again a few weeks later.

  Worst robot vacuum that I've ever owned. It gets stuck everywhere and my house is tidy. It can get itself on a scale and get stuck. It gets stuck at the toilet, dining chairs, cabinets, bathroom rugs. I reached out to the manufacturer. At first they were helpful. Gave me 2 invisible barriers which they did and I performed every task they told me do to improve it's efficiency. This only thing that helped was moving it to center and cleaning the metal charging areas with a Mr. Eraser. At least it didn't die as it had been in combination with getting stuck. The only time it completes a job is if I'm home and able to redirect it. Utterly awful. Contacted them multiple times they repeated themselves frequently stating it was ""environmental"" and that is just not acceptable. My house is tidy. I've had cheaper models that performed 100% better than this one. In addition, it is extremely loud. And it is absurd that the vacuum can't transition from tile to bathroom rugs that are heavy some of the time but not all the time. I spoke to a supervisor. She continued to refer me to Amazon repeated over and over that they couldn't do anything even though I offered several times that I'm willing to ship it back in original packaging and pay the difference for a better model. They repeated over and over that they didn't have that ""program"" and refused to escalate my unsatisfactory experience and lack of resolution to a higher manager stating they would tell me the same thing. DO NOT buy! Awful!!!!!!!

  This is our second robot vacuum. The first was a cheaper shark ninja that did a great job but broke after just 18 months. It also had a very poor app. So we figured we'd upgrade to the real thing. What a mistake.This thing is LOUD on the hardwood floors. Easily 2x as loud as the ninja. It gets stuck in places our old robot navigated easily. It makes all kinds of beeping noises that you can't turn off. It has trouble docking, so much that we have to pick it up and place it back on the dock about half the time.And most importantly, it's a mediocre vacuum. It does not do nearly as good a job on the hardwood as the ninja. And it pushes big piles of dog hair and dirt to the edges of the area rugs, but the 1/2"" height difference means the vacuum can't pick up the piles. So I am sweeping a full dustpan every day after it is done.I would return it but we missed the window because we were distracted by pandemic issues. Now I'm stuck with this $270 piece of junk. I am likely going to trash it after a few months and buy another brand.

  Ended up returning this item for a number of reasons. First off, it is very noisy. Secondly, it gets ¡°lost.¡± Even when placed right in front of its charging station, it bumps around like a drunken fool. Tried multiple locations and it just kept getting lost and losing charge contacts. I would manually place in on its charging station, and it would come off the dock even though not charged. Its suctioning isn¡¯t all that, either. I bought it for the name recognition. After this disappointing experience, I did a more thorough research on these kind of vacuums, and purchased another brand that was top rated on consumer reports.

  First off, WOW. We sweep and mop every day and turns out we were missing A LOT. This thing gets everything. We have a cat and it is EXCELLENT at picking up all her loose hair! So far, it has saved me literally 24 hours worth of sweeping.My only complaints:1. We have an awfully squeaky wheel. We've tried seeing if something is catching it, but nope. Sometimes it's worse than others.2. Docking is a NIGHTMARE. We basically have to pick it up and put it directly in front of the dock for it to dock itself. If we don't, it wanders aimlessly. It seems to only detect its dock when it's a yard away from it, and facing it.3. It goes it very weird, erratic patterns. Gets the job done in about an hour, though.Despite this, it was still worth the money. I can control it with Google Assistant and with my phone. It's a champ.

  We have a Roomba and love it (dog owners) and decided to purchase one for my mother in law. She seemed hesitant at first but after she began using it...she loved it. She watches our dogs occasionally which would cause her stress from their shedding and mess they would create. This helped ease some of that stress. She uses it daily. The only con is that it doesn't work on carpets...but it works well on hard surfaces. It doesn't give a deep clean but definitely keeps the floor clear of dust bunnies.Its definitely more reliable than my husband. It also does what I want...better than my husband.

  I did the test to see which Roomba I should buy is this is the one that was suggested. It gets stuck in the same places every time it runs. It also cannot figure out the layout of my open floor plan. I have reset it a few times and it still completely misses one side of my kitchen. It's easier for me to vacuum.

  Reliable basic vacuum but not for a deep cleaning. I will buy the version that map the house next time, since this version vacuums the same area for several times leaving some other areas unclean. Battery life is excellent and maintenance is simple and easy.

  The vacuum portion worked well and got a lot of dog hair. However, I returned it for a few reasons. First, it would get stuck every single time on something. I used it for over a month and never once did it finish a cycle.  Second; it would never go back to its dock. Even when you hit the dock button, it would roam around until the battery died. Lastly, when it did get to the dock, half the time it wouldn¡¯t charge. It seems to go into the dock at full speed so it wouldn¡¯t keep its contact to the charging station. So I would go the next day to vacuum and it was dead.

  I bought this as a novelty item, but realized pretty quickly that it actually does a decent job. The machine is a bit... dumb... it likes to harass my guitar on the stand, which admittedly, is quite hilarious to watch, and it often gets stuck between chair legs before eventually finding its way out.This thing is a monster when it goes over things. It reveals its massive drive wheels and will pretty much drive up onto anything that is less than an inch high. Works great on my low and medium pile carpets. It is somewhat destructive to pet food/water bowls, so make sure you pick those up before running a cycle.This model does not learn your floor plan, so be prepared to watch it bump into the same spots constantly, but it doesn't seem to miss a whole lot, either. It has trouble finding the dock when the battery is low, but that might be partly due to me putting the dock in a potentially hard to find area. If/when it does find the dock, it's pretty cool to watch it hone in.Emptying the thing is easy, and you'll be amazed as to how much it gets up. Gave it 4 stars, saving the 5 for the one with the ability to learn floor plan, if I get one.

  I would not buy this. The algorithm is random and dumb so it cleans the same corner of the room repeatedly and misses the same spots after running for an hour (it doesn't go back and forth like you might expect, it randomly bounces off walls). It gets itself lodged in weird spots and contrary to other comments it's very loud. I'm not sure how it got so many positive reviews but I deeply regret purchasing.After doing more research, I would get the more expensive model with room mapping or get another brand. As is it's useless and ridiculous.

  Works fine but is definitely a lot more noisy than one we bought for upstairs (a cheaper brand). I have resorted to switching them because I cannot stand to listen to the noise.

  ETA 10/9/2020:  This unit does great on hard surfaces like the front hall and the kitchen.  It does great around the perimeter of the room and under furniture.  It goes over those areas about a billion times.  It's actually under the dining room table for the fifth time this morning right now.  We don't eat at the table, so there's only hair/dust for it to vacuum.  I'm sure it got all of that the first or second pass,What it doesn't do a good job of is the center of the room (i.e. the high-traffic areas).  Seriously, I think I could do better with dustbuster!  I think it would do much better if it went back and forth in a logical pattern instead of rambling around aimlessly.ETA:  I'm annoyed that when I use the app or the button on top of the robot to tell it to go back to its dock, it keeps on cleaning and cleaning and cleaning.  This morning, my cats activated it around 6am, and I heard it running when my alarm went off at 6:30.  I used the app to tell it to go back to the dock.  When I came downstairs a little before 7, it was still running.  I pushed the dock button on top of the robot, and it kept cleaning till the battery ran out, at which time I had to move the sofa to get to it so I could carry it back to the dock.The Roomba has run 5 times so far.  I ran it twice the first day since it spent most of its time on the perimeters of the rooms and not enough time in the center where the hair shedding feline monster spends most of his time.  I wasn't terribly impressed the first day.  I did learn how to get it to concentrate on a specific area, though.The second day was better.  It was able to figure out how to get into the front hall and the kitchen and did a decent job overall.  The cats managed to turn it on at 10 o'clock last night, but when they came charging upstairs I heard the whirring and used the app to send it back to the dock.  It's now running for the 5th time.I empty the bin after each run, and it's been full each time.  I'm absolutely amazed by how much dust, human hair, and cat hair it has picked up, and a little embarrassed that I didn't realize the carpet was so dirty!  Roomba even sucked up two catnip toys that it found hidden under the sofa the first day, but I was able to retrieve them.If it keeps cleaning this well, I'll be happy with the money I spent.

  It is constantly getting stuck. I have to run it when I¡¯m home so I can babysit it because it is always getting stuck. A lot of times the battery runs out before it gets all of my floor because it seems to wander aimlessly and vacuum the same spaces over and over while completely missing other areas.

  I am a single, working mom (also in grad school) who has no time to keep up with all the cleaning a house requires, but not enough disposable income to afford a regular maid service.  Even with a hypo-allergenic dog and only one child, my floors get dirty daily; the dog's fur is velcro for leaves and pollen-y tassels that fall from trees, the child's shoes somehow end up on every surface imaginable, and crumbs are just a fact of life.  I'd recruit the kid's help but she's not yet big enough to do the job well.A couple years ago I tried to get a cheaper robot vacuum instead of spending the extra $ on a roomba, but ended up disappointed and frustrated with how much I had to ""rescue"" the vacuum.  It didn't perform any better than I did, so I eventually threw it away.Enter corona quarantine:  we are in our house 24/7 whereas before we were here to sleep and maybe 4-5 waking hours. Those extra waking hours walking across the floors magnified the problem: I realized I was spending at least 30 minutes per day trying to keep the floors clean, and not doing a great job as I have arthritis and bending is difficult.  I caved.  I need help, and decided to give robot vacuums another shot.  After extensive research and seeing the affordable price on Amazon, I ordered this Roomba and figured if it had performance issues like the last one I could just return it.It arrived and I could tell right away that the quality of the materials was superior to the previous vacuum - the wheels alone are like monster truck wheels compared to the previous one's toy-like wheels.  But did it REALLY perform any better?Yes. yes. yes. If I could marry this vacuum, I would. It cleaned my floors so well, I had to empty the canister twice on  the first run.  It has an app that lets you start it and send it home. I have been using it daily on both floors of my house, and it looks like they were just cleaned all of the time.  No more stepping on pollen tassels, wondering ""is that a leaf or a bug over there?"" or looking at tiny fluffy undercoat hairs that fly off my hypoallergenic dog.  This thing is a godsend. Total game changer. Do it.

I gotta tell you I vacuumed with my dyson (not that it does not do a good job at all) but this roomba still gets to collect stuff that I probably missed while I vacuumed. My mother in law grinched when I bought this because it was $200 at the holiday season time, but I let her vaccines the house, then clean floors with mop, and then I tuned the rooomba on, only to be able to show her that this machine bipasses human good instincts when cleaning (LOL)So I only assume that if you buy the more high tech version of this product, the results should be higher.

  I was hoping for more. I was thinking that this vacuum would clean the whole floor in a *somewhat* methodical way. Instead, it just shuffles around aimlessly and totally randomly, passing right by debris as it goes. You can't program it to learn your floorplans. What's even more frustrating is that we have rugs with different colored square patterns. This stupid thing just gets stuck in one tiny square because it mistakes the edges of each color for different ""obstacles"" and won't cross over the lines.

  Two girls with long hair, two cats, and a dog. That's what this Roomba has to deal with. He does a decent job tidying up the place, but I still vacuum once or twice a week and pick up a disgusting amount of hair that he misses.He's also dumb as a box of rocks. He's constantly getting stuck under stuff and has to beat his way out of it. He also doesn't go in a nice, neat pattern. Oh no, he goes all over the damn place for one corner to the other. He misses spots if you aren't guiding him. A lot of missed spots.He offers a little bit of pet exercise. The animals used to follow him around until they bored of him. Now that point is null and void for me.I bought my Roomba on Black Friday and two weeks later, I had to buy a new TV and TV stand because of him. He kept getting stuck under the TV stand and banging against the leg of it until the leg finally moved out from under the stand and sent the 50"" flat screen TV stand crashing down. So yeah, I might have saved $150 or whatever it was on the Black Friday deal, but he cost me a helluva lot more than that. Thankfully the Roomba wasn't hurt in the Fall of the TV. Even though he's just average at his job, because of how much he cost me, he will vacuum my house until he can't vacuum no more.Honestly, I'm not sure if I would recommend or not.

  I've had mainly hardwood and now tile floors. Our new house is much larger and having to vacuum and sweep was getting to be a lot of work due to cat hair and lots of dust & debris. Due to the recent stay at home orders, I cancelled my cleaning lady and wasn't looking forward to doing that. So at the suggestion of my friend who has a Roomba, I ordered one.The first time I used it, I just let it loose in the house. I cleaned its basket every 30 mins, and boy, was it dusty after going under furniture that needed cleaning. After 2 hours the battery was done & it returned to base to recharge but there was still so much more to do. My friend said put up some barriers around the rooms/areas you want to do, and just do that. Then move to another area after its charged up again. That worked!Yes, I talk to it. Its very entertaining. I asked ""The Borg"", the name I gave it, what are you trying to do? I love that it talks to me when it's stuck, and that the app on my cell updates me how its doing.

  I was fairly pleased with the cleaning ability for our wood floors.  It even got into places we normally wouldn't/couldn't vacuum.  The only problem with this model is that it does not have floor mapping.  After running it a few times, it was easy to see that that is a necessary function when you have a large or complex floorplan.  It is just too random, cleaning some spots over and over and leaving others.  Also, it also finds its way back to the base by the same method, so 9 times out of 10, it will run out of battery, stranded somewhere in the house.  I returned this model and ordered the Roomba 960, which has the floor mapping software.

  Fantastic at everyday clean up, small crumbs, really minimal dirt and food particles. Not exactly the most adept at cleaning pet hair or longer hair. Great for plug and forget type of cleaning, not so much for targeted messes, which I suppose is the whole point.Still comes highly recommended!

  I use it to vacuum a 2000 square foot condo once a week. We have a dog and it takes care of dog hair. We turn it on within a confined area of the house. Go shopping. When we come home  that area is done and the vacuum is recharged. We then move it to another area until the entire house is cleaned.

  Great vacuum but you get what you pay for. Not gonna do the job you would probably expect out of a $800+ Roomba, but for $200 I love it.

  The Roomba 675 misses large areas when cleaning, gets stuck frequently, and rarely is able to return to its charging station on its own.

  <U+00A0>We ordered the vacuum for our new house. We only use it for the open areas of the living room, dining room, kitchen, sun room and bar area. All are wood flooring but 2 area rugs in dining and living room.This is good for daily runs to pick up pet hair, we have 2 dogs and a cat, and dirt from outside. It runs for about 1 1/2 hours and can get most spots. A good purchase for our use.Downfalls are that we still use vacuum to deep clean the carpets since the robot only picks up the hair on the top and suction is not good enouth to get everything.  The furniture isn't moved but the robot still seems to get lost or cannot map the area very well. It runs into the table, couch and end tables all the time. It also doesn't always return to the charging station so you have to find it and put it back on.No issues emptying the bin daily and still feel it was a good purchase. To me, it is not worth the extra money to upgrade and get one that will self empty on its dock since you still have to empty that.

  The Rommba cleaned the area rugs without any type of pattern. Cleaned diagonally at random  and missed much of the rug. The unit could not transfer from hard wood to area rugs. Roomba did not have enough power to lift itself from the hardwood floor up onto the area rugs. We have 1/2"" high area rugs and Roomba could not lift itself up on them. Maybe if you have flat area rugs it may work. Doesn't teach itself as stated and just runs in a random pattern. On hardwoods, it didn't clean well and the rotating circular brushes semmed to move the dirt around and not vacuum up the dirt. We returned this item and I would not recommend it.

  Over the course of an hour, this thing will just clean the same two areas over and over and leave most of the room dirty. Without fail it crosses the length of the living room and then obsesses over some area. Then it goes all the way across the room, hits the wall and goes back to the same spot. Over and over. It¡¯s not getting any smarter. This is after picking up all the dog toys, moving curtains, making sure nothing on TV trays will topple over.

The only thing I could think of with people having issues with Roomba and dog hair is that they don't clean out the deposit enough after it completes jobs! With dog hair you do have to clean and possibly cut the hair out of the sweepers to keep it clear and clean! if you have dogs and want to get you house cleaned without lifting a finger ORDER THIS NOW :) hope this helped people with LOTS of doggo hair like me!!

  This product only does s fair ""sweeping"" job. We use it on our hardwood floors only. It is basically useless on carpets. It does not have nearly enough weight or suction power to get deep into carpet fibers. Also, the product does not ""learn"" the layout of the area it is cleaning. Ours gets stuck in the same f#$@&*! spot EVERY SINGLE TIME we use it. Very annoying!!It is too expensive to have such limited use and require so much attention while it's running.

  I have a dog and 2 cats. I thought I kept up with it all pretty well with my Shark vacuum cleaner. When that reached the end of it's life, a friend recommended a Roomba. It's incredible. I have it run on a schedule every day, and every day it finds more hair and debris. It goes under beds and tables, on carpet and tile. My house has never been so clean. A real Life-Changer!

  VERY DISAPPOINTED!!! Wish I had the option to give it a 1/2 a star.  I am so disappointed with this IRobot Roomba. I owned a different Brand ""Neato"" it was an amazing machine. This Roomba gets stuck constantly and even though I get a message on my phone there is nothing I can do besides ending the cleaning because it needs to be picked up and move to a different location. It does not transition from hardwood to area rug at all. Very disappointed. I meant to return it before the 30 days but I kept trying different locations in the home and by the time I knew it, the time to return it was up by 2 days. Now I am stuck with a vacuum that does not fulfill my needs.  :(

  If I had it to do over, I would not buy this - I¡¯d buy the Shark with mapping instead. The Roomba picks up well but it just randomly roams the house, bumping into everything and often going in circles. The only way to get a room clean is to close the door and let it bump and and roam in a confined space. I should have spent another $50 and gotten a better product.

Also I don¡¯t like that the iRobot only has one set of brushes that stick out on the one side. It is also to tall to fit in under anything. Luckily my goovi gets under there. I have also noticed that it skips a bunch of areas. Long story short. Save you $80-100 and buy yourself a goovi.

  We love our little Roomba. Does it do the best job as a stand alone (one time use) vacuum..... not really, but when you set it off to go everyday it does a great job of picking up more and more and keeping the carpets clean everyday looks great! It¡¯s only gotten hung up on a ledge once and we have to block off the underside of our sofa otherwise it gets stuck underneath. You do have to be mindful of the storage bag and make sure to empty it after Just about every use (depending on how much it¡¯s sucking up) so it doesn¡¯t fill up and doesn¡¯t work as good.

The first time we used him he went everywhere, under beds, behind couches, under tables, etc. so it can do all of that if you want but we still use a vacuum on a regular basis for that so we mainly wanted it to catch the daily living messes and crumbs and that it does well!

  Okay the concept is good, battery length, easy to clean.  But here are the problems.  It doesn't learn a room, misses a lot and I think a big part of the reason is that it blows out on the opposite end of the suction, then doesn't go back for what it blew away.  Best for enclosed rooms, not an open concept home.  They should put the fan on top.

  I was skeptical. Friends have Roombas and I still wasn't sold. Then it was on the Treasure Truck and sale on the site. I caved. 2 cats and me having blonde hair plus hard floors means hairballs no matter how often we swept and vaccumed. Not anymore. I've never been a household gadget lover like I am now. Or maybe it's just my Roomba. I may even get another one--one for each floor of the house.It runs for about an hour and a half on either floor right now. I'm a freak, so I try to pause it in the middle to empty the dirt cup. It doesn't always work out that way, which is fine. I do make sure to run it every other day, though. The app lets you schedule day and time, making using it easy and worry-free.

I have found that hair gets in between the shaft and cause it to seize. You have to take the screw off and clean it up then it starts back up no problem.

  We have had this roomba for about 3 months and use it almost daily.  My original expectations was to have it running through various rooms while we were at work.  We quickly discovered that the roomba cannot be unattended.  I spend a lot of time getting it ¡°unstuck¡± from various locations around the house. It does clean well but it¡¯s not perfect.  My vacuum cleaner does a better job.  It does leave stuff behind but if you use it frequently it will eventually get the entire room.I run it daily in the kitchen because that is where the most activity and dirt occurs.  It does a wonderful job in there.  I alternate between rooms every day. We have pets and I have not noticed any pet hair accumulation since purchasing the roomba.  My floors are always clean and that saves me time in the long run.The roomba has the most difficult time in the living room because of more obstacles in there. It gets stuck underneath the couches and in between furniture and it is a pain to retrieve it.We use it upstairs in the bedrooms on the weekends and it does fine. Enviably it will die underneath our king size bed just out of arms reach.It does not find the docking station very well and rarely will return on its on.  I have to place it on there which is difficult to get it lined up perfectly.  I usually set it a few feet away and ¡°send it home¡± so it will align itself on the station. Another issue I have recently encountered is it is having a hard time docking correctly.  It goes to the docking station but won¡¯t attach to it.  I finally moved the docking station to a carpeted area because it seemed to work better on the carpet than the wood floor.Overall I am happy with the purchase.  The app and being able to control with Alexa is very beneficial. It has a few flaws but I¡¯m sure later models will resolve some of these issues.

  I had the Roomba 550 for 11ish years! I used it almost everyday for my now family of 6 kids, 2 adults, 3 dogs and 3 cats. Vacuum grew with us and was my trusty sweeping companion. When it took its last constantly circling final sweep we knew it was time to say goodbye.What to do? I certainly couldn¡¯t live without it.... I could but don¡¯t tell the hubby. We decided to look at a new brand. Mistake.So we went back to the trusty iRobot brand. We got the 675 and it¡¯s just like my old one with a few new upgrades. I have been so relieved!<U+2022>The extra parts from my old unit (filters, brushes, invisible walls, charging dock) all work with my new buddy!<U+2022>It does an even better job at getting up dust and hair then my old one. Although I would still recommend using a manual vacuum on occasion to get the deep down stuff in carpet.<U+2022> It has pleasant alert sounds. (Some people would say that this doesn¡¯t matter but get one that sends blaring beeps at you and you¡¯ll change your mind) This one has a lost robot feature. When you push the button from your phone the robot makes a sound so you can find it. It sounds like ¡®Marco.... Polo....¡¯ is being played. I delight in that. (Lay off I¡¯m a girly girl and find things like that cute.)<U+2022>The phone app is nice but I don¡¯t find it too useful.

  Best best best purchase we ever made in our lives! We run it everyday and it helps SO much to cut down on me having to vacuum everyday! Only thing is it doesn¡¯t do a good job going back to its dock. Takes forever! It is a little loud so we don¡¯t watch tv with it on! I have really long hair and I shed myself so my hair gets trapped in the bottom of it and the little brush that spins. Other then that amazing to have! Love it!

  Useless ""smart"" robot. Goes over and over on the same routes, avoiding big parts of the floor- especially towards the center of the room. Leaves the floor half cleaned at best- and if you have pet hair on the floor, most of it will be pushed away by the air which is pushed out by the Roomba( towards the back, and at the floor lever). Very poor design and the functioning algorithm was designed by a 5th grader.

  I was VERY hesitant about purchasing this product when I initially made the decision to order. I dug around online, checked out videos, read every review I could find. Finally, I decided to go ahead with the purchase after having assured myself that if I wasn¡¯t completely charmed, I¡¯d return it. I was both delighted and surprised to see this thing get to work. I have a household that needs LOTS of vacuuming: two cats, and three people with long, luscious locks. We run Major Tobo (as we have lovingly named our faithful assistant) once a day, and are consistently impressed with the amount of hair and dust that come up. Having the roomba has SIGNIFICANTLY decreased the number of times we need to pull out our Dyson. One half of our home is hardwood, and the other half is carpet- Major Tobo cleans both with ease. The dust bin is very easy to clean out, and we usually have to pull hair out from the bristles, but that¡¯s the case with any vacuum at our house. The roomba genuinely leaves our house looking clean- we can turn it on for a session before having company over and rely on it to have the place looking good when they get here. We¡¯ve had it for just about four months now and the only problem we¡¯ve run into has been it¡¯s habit of getting stuck on the fringe of our carpet, at which point I get a helpful alert to my iRobot app to inform me that Major Tobo is stuck and needs my help. Our cats (one of whom is an anxious boi) do not take rides on the roomba, but they remain unperturbed when Major Tobo is making it¡¯s rounds. Very happy with this purchase, I¡¯d recommended this product to anyone who has a busy schedule and likes to keep a tidy home.

  I purchased this vacuum about a year or so ago. At first I thought it was doing a pretty good job. After having it for some time, I found it getting stuck under some furniture that it hadn't in the past. Then it kept going back to the same rooms it had already cleaned and I would have to stop it and move it. I found myself having to watch it the whole time it cleaned. I would try to send it back to it's charging station and it would get lost. Not worth my time. Faster to just vacuum myself.

  The concept is great - why not have a robot sweep for you daily? The issue with this is, if you have a bigger house/area that needs cleaning, it¡¯s so inefficient and does such a poor job of covering/cleaning the entire area that it¡¯s counterintuitive.I found myself having to stop it and put it back on my area rugs over and over again. Instead of going in a logical pattern to clean the area, it goes in a straight line right off the area rug, and continually navigates to a small hallway area (3x5 feet) by my garage and will stay there for like 15 min. It will then come out, only to go back and stay there for another 10 min.The whole purpose of this product is to not have to worry about cleaning, and I found myself spending more time moving it to areas I actually needed cleaning than if I just cleaned the area myself.Save yourself $270 and buy a broom or a much less expensive vacuum.

  It's a convenient way to maintain your floors in between actual cleaning. One problem we personally encounters was its ability to detect stairs.

  We have had our iRobot Roomba for a week and it's already made a huge difference in helping keep the house clean and picking up sand and dirt that comes in from our shoes.  I was really considering a more expensive version that had advanced mapping and other advanced features, but this one got so many great reviews I figured I'd give it a shot and am happy we did.I noticed a lot of reviewers name their robot, so my wife named ours HAL.  HAL is parked in the mudroom and has a 7am wakeup call everyday to clean our entire 1st floor.  Our 1st floor is open concept (kitchen, living room, dining room) and all hardwood or tile with a few area rugs.  It's about 1200 sq ft.  There's also a kitchen island HAL needs to negotiate and 2 separate rooms.  Sometimes HAL goes into those rooms and spends too much time there.  But for the majority of the time, HAL gets himself out of jams and manages to clean the entire 1st floor.I knew we would be emptying HAL's debris compartment, so I wont give a low score based on that, but I can definitely see the value in purchasing a more expensive robot that self-empties it's compartment.  The compartment doesn't hold a lot so we empty ours after every run.  But not having a more expensive one to compare to, I don't know how much better that really is.HAL tells you when he's stuck.  Today he got stuck under the couch by driving up and over a power strip.  I freed him and he went on to clean more stuff.  He's also never run out of battery, he always manages to find his way back to his charging station.I'd definitely recommend this product.

  I had a different make previously which worked fine but it needed parts  so for not much more than parts for a 9 y/o I decided to get this Roomba. I am disappointed. It picks up dust  and surface debris, but judging by the bin, not much else.When I watched it a couple days ago in the living/dining area, it kept repeating going over the same places over and over. totally missing other areas. Again, little plant debris mainly and bird seed near the door. It docked itself. I still had to use a Dyson stick to finish the job where Roomba never went.The worst issue was yesterday it was put fully-charged in my closed bedroom. There were some little pieces of fern on the floor which were not picked up anywhere in the circled around the fern, and a few other places were missed. Roomba had died in the closet.

  Unfortunately, this is a very negative review. The unit that we purchased always had difficulty returning to its charging station which was properly located along a wall, unencumbered by anyting. we even changed the charging station location and number of times and still had the same result. The vacuum would not return to the charging station on its own even when prompted. I always had to pick it up and place it in the charging station which was ridiculous. also the vacuum had a great deal of difficulty leaving certain rooms and completing its cleaning of the house. during the process of our ownership of this unit we actually moved to another house and we experienced the exact same problems. We found the devices cleaning operation to be sorely lacking. Specifically it didn't pick up sand and was very poor an overall cleaning. Hopefully this was just a defective product and not a defective product line, however I've lost confidence in this unit and will not accept the replacement. Amazon was good enough to issue a full refund even though the return was outside of the return window.

  At first I really loved this vacuum. I have 3 dogs, they dont shed very much and the robot was doing a good job picking up hair and everything from our rug and works great on the rest of the house which is hard floors. But I began to notice that when it leaves the rug on to our hard floor it leaves hair all over and its gross. I just end up using the regular vacuum on the rug which is a bit of a pain as the roomba was supposed to be good enough. Overall I do like it for the rest of the house.

  Stopped working (Doesn't charge) after 1 month.  Then they make you do all these service fixes to see what the problem is.  I went through the steps and it still wasn't working.  Then called back to see if Roomba will send me a new one.If it's broken, just take it back and send me a NEW one!You have to jump through so many hoops, when it's the manufacturer's fault that it's not working.I got a ECOVACS DEEBOT last time and it worked way better.  Cleaned much better and at least lasted 2 years before breaking.

  My husband bought this for me two years ago. It is going strong, but I also clean it with a cleaning kit from another brand at least once a month. I've only had one issue. About one year I to using this, my machine quit making proper contact to charge on the port. If this happens to you, just remove the front wheel and put one to two washer between the front while and machine. For some reason, after a certain amount of use the wheel tends to mov deeper inside the machine which affects it's ability to charge.

  Bought this because we have two dogs that shed -a lot. Daily vacuuming is a must. However, I spend more time digging hair out of the brush bearings and the front wheel bearing than its worth. Brushes are easily removed, but the pet hair wound in them is not. left alone the brushes will bind up and stop working.A small roller is at it's leading edge, and after a short time it stops turning due to pet hair binding. The roller snaps into place, but not really designed for frequent removal.  I can see the day coming when it will no longer stay in place.This picks up surface dirt only, vacuum is two weak for deep cleaning.

  I'm not sure how I lived so long without a robot vacuum.  This little guy is such a help for a working mom who always puts sweeping on the back burner.I did a ton of research before I settled on the iRobot version and everything pointed to iRobot from suction power to speed.  The only thing that never came up in my research was the noise.  This guy is loud.  If I'm working from home I have to take calls from another room while he's on (although that doesn't happen often since I've scheduled him to run while I'm usually not on phone calls).  It didn't dawn on me just how loud he was until I was at a friends house who has a deebot which is SO darn quiet.  We had no idea it was running till my son pointed out ""they have a robot too!""  We were floored.With that being said - I'm not aware of the suction power or quality of hers in comparison to the iRobot.  I just wanted to add ""noise"" to my review so others who are researching will be aware that this little guy is loud!

  This replaced my Samsung Powerbot. Paid nearly $600 for that. After a year it wouldn¡¯t charge on the dock. Warranty sent a new dock but wouldn¡¯t work still.Decided to get a Roomba. Little skeptical since it was half the cost. All I can say is wow.Sometimes it gets lost and can¡¯t find its way back. Big deal. The $600 mapping Samsung did too.Downside is the rollers are much smaller and fit inside the wheels instead of running the full width of the machine. The side spinning brush doesn¡¯t do much.The robot randomly bounces around. Everyday there is a bunch of hair and dirt in the catch bin so it¡¯s definitely working. The bin is much larger than the Samsung I had.I ended up getting a second Roomba for my upstairs. Great value.

It picks up pet hair and pretty much anything else.  Another thing I like is it¡¯s simplicity to work on.  A couple of times there has been dust or hair that has clogged the brush.

Right after we got it and hooked it up to the wifi, it was great. 2 days later, it wouldnt connect to the app and it was running whenever it felt like it (without it being ""scheduled""). We reset it and started from scratch. This has happened 3 times now. It also gets ""stuck on cliffs"" that are not there. Like in the middle of my living room. Its very random when it happens. I would definitely purchase the one that cleans itself when it docks if you have any animals. We did not and regret it. It has a hard time finding its docking station often so we find him with a dead battery in random places. I guess if you dont really want a roomba to really do much, its for you.

  I purchased this on a flash deal for the roomba 675. I've been eyeballing robot vacuums for a while now, but couldn't justify the cost. I also have 4 cats and 1 dog and have been a bit paranoid about the horror stories I've read. Once it was delivered, I proceeded to unpackage it. Quick instructions on setting this up. I let it charge (which took less time than the instructions stated). Once it was charged, I set up the house with ""barriers"" in places I didn't want it to go. Shut the door to the mud room so it didn't go in there and then started it up.Off it went like a drunk uncle during Christmas dinner. It was banging into everything all over the place. I chalked it up to the learning phase. But boy, oh boy, did it remind of the drunk uncle stories. You know, that uncle that gets drunk during family gatherings, but everyone still loves. From this point on, I decided it needed a drunk uncle name. Mine is called uncle Otis.Uncle Otis went to town on my house. So much that I didn't think he was going to make it back before the battery ran out. On the app, I told it to go dock. Uncle Otis (like a typical drunk uncle) didn't really listen and just kept on cleaning. I think he finally staggered home, but barely. I really was not expecting uncle Otis to actually clean as well as my regular vacuum. I have an expensive Kirby vacuum and couldn't imagine this little guy could outdo it. I also had vacuumed previous to getting this just to give the poor guy a chance. To my surprise, the container was chalk FULL of animal hair and debris. I couldn't believe it, but uncle Otis was able to get a deeper clean than my expensive, fancy vacuum.Day two: I started uncle Otis up. Still banged into a bunch of things, but not as hard this time. I guess he finally started get some lay of the land. Poor guy was also going into nooks and crannies I couldn't reach with my regular vacuum. I think he became friends with a spider under my entertainment center. He came out fully decorated in spider silk... Only catch today was that he tried to get under the coffee table and got stuck. Had to free him and start him back up. Off he went again. After he was done cleaning, I emptied him. The container was 3/4 full of hair and debris. Man, uncle Otis is a beast!Day three: I gave uncle Otis the day off.Day four: I was working from home, so I started him up and went upstairs to work. I swear, about every 10 minutes, uncle Otis was stuck under the coffee table again. I finally let him have his way and raised the coffee table with some wood blocks. Uncle Otis was happy he could get under there. Still a decent amount of hair and debris after the run. I'm not sure, but I think uncle Otis is trying to mess with me. Either that, or my animals are filthy!Overall, I am extremely happy with this purchase. Uncle Otis does a great job vacuuming. He hasn't had any problem transitioning from carpet to hardwood floors to rugs. I even braved taking him upstairs to clean. I was a bit concerned about him stumbling down the stairs, but he was great at stopping before the great tumble. It is a bit scary, as he does head toward the edge at a pretty fast speed. But he never once tumbled.He still picks up a ton of hair and debris. This actually makes me happy as that is nasty that I could be breathing. And it's wonderful having a happy little robot that can vacuum while I do something else.Every once in a while, he has his ""moments"". The last time I ran him, he had somehow knocked the charging station into the middle of the hallway and placed himself where he should have docked... But sideways. Goofy ole uncle Otis.

  I have a german shepherd that sheds like crazy in the spring. It definitely helps keep up on the dog hair. It goes in a random pattern and often goes over the same spot multiple times but it always looks like it is doing a good job. The tray is full every day. I'd say once a week it dies before finding home but whatever I like it. Husband was mad I didnt get the one with mapping technology but I think this does just fine. It is pretty loud so I run it while I am at work.

  Works great for hardwood floors and pet hair that has clumped up in hard to reach areas. However the roomba has no sense of direction and just randomly bumps into items and around the house and does not return to charger when finished so you have to hunt the thing down when it dies.

  The robot does a decent job of bouncing around the house cleaning, but it does not learn its environment or make a map so it doesn't vacuum efficiently and I am never sure what rooms got covered. The purpose of the wifi is pretty limited. I have mine connected to my Echo and I can say ""Alexa tell roomba to clean"" and it will start the robot. This is nice because the charging dock is under a cabinet where it camps nicely out of the way, but also where I couldn't easily push the clean button on top. The app only shows that a job is started or finished, how long it took and if the robot got stuck or ran out of battery. I can remember only one time that the robot left it's base, cleaned for an hour and then made it back to its base by itself to charge. It usually just runs out of battery after about 1.5 hours and I find it somewhere in the house. After vacuuming for an hour and a half, the bin is always full of dust and crumbs. I keep a clean house and have a cleaner come twice a month. If you don't have a robot vacuum, you are likely living in filth and just don't know it. There are some obstacles it doesn't handle well. It will get wedged under my futon if I don't put something in place to block it from going under. If there is a phone charging cable on the floor it will get tangled up in it. Sometimes it sees dark lines in the carpet and turns as if it is the edge of a cliff. Jarvis (what I named my roomba) is kind of a dick to my one year old son and I think the experience will put some deep seeded mistrust of robots in his psyche.

To this day, I still cant get it to connect to the internet for programmed cleaning, and when it is manually started it will run for over an hour. It bangs around into things, and has learned the house somewhat. It picks up dog hair but will roll right over dead grass the dogs drag in from the yard.

  This has changed my life. I work full time and have two long haired dogs and two kids. Vacuuming on the weekends just wasn¡¯t cutting it.I set Roomba up to clean every morning at 8am right after we leave. I know some people are worried about the dog poop thing, but my thought is if you have it set up to go right after you leave for work, then the pets have just been outside.Another perk is that my dogs HATE the regular vacuum cleaner, but they don¡¯t mind Roomba at all -not even when it bumps in to them.Now and then the Roomba can¡¯t find its way back to the charger and just keeps going and going until the battery runs down.  But that doesn¡¯t bother me- I will get a notification that Roomba cleaned for 2 hours and 35 minutes but then ended the job with low battery. You can imagine how great the floors look after being vacuumed for that long!

  I absolutely love <U+2764><U+FE0F> this thing!!! I got it from Amazon Warehouse for a lot cheaper then buying it new and it came in the original box <U+0001F4E6> with all the packing as if new. It looked like someone opened the box then closed it and returned it. It had all original parts and booklets and was still in the new wrapping. The booklet says to charge for 3 hours but I recommend charging longer before you use it for your first sweeping <U+0001F9F9> job. It was really easy to hook up to WiFi and the Roomba/iRobot app gave you step by step easy instructions that I believe anyone could follow and set up this lil guy. The app allows you to control the Roomba and start/stop jobs; return to the dock; and make it play sounds when you want to find it in your home.  It dose excellent in the space I have it set up for and cleans 3/4 rooms no problems. I honestly was shocked after emptying the dirt/dust bin on this and seeing how much was in it considering I gust swept <U+0001F9F9> my floors with my Shark and Dyson about 2 days prior to running the Roomba for the first time. It dose good on carpet but obviously it will not deep clean the carpet as a standard vacuum. It handle the thick rugs no problem and leaves the hardwood and linoleum/tile floors spotless! I run it every day and am truly amazed on how much it picks up! It would do great at picking up pet hair as well. I am very satisfied with my purchase and may be ordering a second one for the other portion of the house <U+0001F3E1>. This thing saves so much time it is incredibly! Instead of sweeping sweeping every day or every other day I can sweep once a week or every other week with my traditional vacuumed and my house is spotless.

I¡¯m almost thinking of getting 2 of them so they can work together and hopefully one will make it back to a docking station . I¡¯m even thinking of the mopping one . I recommend this vacuum even with the issues I have , because so far my floors look so much better no more dog hair . Plus I¡¯ve paid well over $200 for a vacuum that I have to do all the work and our time is valuable right ? It¡¯s nice not worrying about cleaning the floors all the time .. now onto the mopping one next..This vacuum also does well well on carpets and gets all the hair off them too .

Rarely can he find his way back home to the charging station and I have to pick him up all dusty after spending and hour trying to find him and place him on it. His new thing is if you don¡¯t place him correctly to the cm on the charge he won¡¯t charge. He¡¯s basically like having an extra child around the house. Where is he, what¡¯s he getting into, oh great he found some cat puke and mashed It up and shot it everywhere.

  Definitely glad I got this. I have 3 dogs, and 3 kids, all hardwood floors, and this keeps everything so much cleaner than sweeping and the normal vacuum. I live next to the beach, so I always have sand coming in from outside. Only thing, is make sure u clean everything on the outside and the inside to prevent it from not charging correctly. But the maintenance is so easy, I am lifetime customer for sure. And so much cheaper (price NOT quality) than the other top name brands.

  I love my Roomba.  It doesn't deep clean but if you deep clean then let your Roomba pick up after the family on an every other day basis, it's great.I have mostly hard floors and the battery has pretty good life .  Carpet takes more battery, but not bad and it docks itself and recharges automatically.As an extremely busy mom, wife, and professional who is gone from home a lot, it makes me feel so much better about the appearance of my house.  It has been worth the expense.It has a small collection chamber so has to be emptied with every other use or so, if you live on a farm and have a wood stove, indoor dog, and a 7 year old boy. =)Highly recommend.  It was recommended to me by my cousin, who loves hers as well.

  I'll preface this with the fact that I work from home so I'm always around when this thing runs. In does in fact get a lot of the dog hair off the floor and reduces the need for us to clean. That said, it is loud, and it is not the brightest robot in the world. It seems to get attached to particular people and will follow them around. It has locked itself in the bathroom, gotten stuck under furniture, and even once tried to escape the house trying to get out the front door.It won't go over the black patterns on our living room rug, and if it does it shuts down and needs to be moved. This is apparently a well known issue with Roombas. The black patterns set off it's cliff sensor.The biggest issue I have with this vacuum is that it NEVER finds it's way back to it's dock. Either i get so frustrated with it following me around and bumping into my feet that i pick it up and dock it myself, or it runs until the battery dies and you have to pick it up and dock it yourself. We've tried the dock in multiple locations following directions with clearances etc and no improvements. It's just a dumb robot that seems to aimlessly wander the house for about 90 minutes before it dies.On the plus side, i don't have to sweep the first level of the house, so the wife is happy (though she isn't home when it runs!).

  With most products, you can count on large numbers of reviews to make a good decision. This is an exception, because your experience with it could differ hugely depending on the conditions in your home.For us the Roomba is useless. We got it for the main floor of our house, which is all hardwood. For the small areas of the floor it is able to successfully navigate, it is capable of removing the daily dust and small debris. But I would say for us its success rate of actually completing a job is about 1 in 50. Seriously, that low. It just always gets stuck on something, and I wouldn't say we have an abnormally complex home. It doesn't do well with floor rugs, usually gets stuck. And it doesn't do well with our furniture. Any furniture that stands 3 to 4 inches off the floor, e.g. the edges of couches, chairs, coffee tables with a lower platform, is just right for it to wedge itself under and get stuck rather than bouncing off, and it usually eventually does. Or it will manage to work its way under the furniture, be unable to work its way out, and eventually die. The very few times it has managed to ""successfully"" complete a job, meaning it has gone for a certain amount of time and finds its way back to the charging base, it has been clear that large areas of the floor were left untouched.Like my headline says, it will be hit or miss with your home. For us, huge miss.

  Dust tray has to be changed too frequently.  House has to be set up for the vacuum.  That means pick up all chairs.  To do a 1500 sq-ft area, I have to change the dust tray 3 times.

  I have a couple large short-haired dogs and my place is all hard floors. Before the Roomba when I would sweep and mop once a week I would pick up a ton of fur. Now I have my roomba set to run every other day and when it gets to my weekly clean I barely have to sweep and I don't find much fur.That being said, the only frustration I have is that the Roomba sometimes has a hard time returning to its base, but that might be where I have it. It also tend to wedge itself under the refrigerator door and errors out as a ""stuck bumper"". I haven't figured out a fix for this yet.All in all, I have been really happy with the purchase I made a few months ago and it's made cleaning a lot easier. I would definitely recommend this unit. Setup was super easy and it seems to do a decent job.

  So we named him butters. And butters was a Christmas present for my mother. I was very leery about this purchase because it has such mixed reviews.  But i love it.! So butters goes to and from the dock with no problems, does an awesome job cleaning the floors and rarely gets stuck. He looks like a drunk man spinning in circles and running into walls but he does great at cleaning under the beds and couches. I have tall furniture. My rugs have never looked better. He does occasionally run over a phone charger and ends up dragging it through the house. He pushed the dogs water bowl into the bathroom once thankfully without spilling it. I would highly recommend getting an iRobot. We only have to sweep our floors once a week now instead of every few days.

  <U+00A0>It is strange that the vacuum moves around in such an odd way. It's supposed to be able to navigate, but I think it's just running a confused path. It misses some spots but eventually goes back gets the misses. It seems to spend a lot of time going over the same spot before it moves on.But it does a good job and it sure beats doing it myself with a manual vacuum.

  So far, I am unimpressed with this and it may be returned shortly.  It is so Incredibly loud thatIt wakes me up when it it starts cleaning at 3:00 am on the floor below us. This is the number one issue for Certain. All of my floors on the main level are hardwood or linoleum.  It gets trapped on a small, very low pile rug in my entry way.

  I'm actually surprised with how good it works. It doesn't have the room tracking so it kinda just chaotically bumps around, but it does go against the walls and objects and almost always seems to get everything I notice on my wood floors.  The only flaw is that you have to pick up literally everything off the floor before running it, which is to be expected. I have cat toys that are always getting in the way. It does really good at getting the cat hair, litter, and general dust up off the floor. Clean the bristles often if you have a pet cause hair will build up.

  We won this iRobot 675 in a raffle. We had been thinking of getting one for sometime but weren¡¯t sure how it¡¯d work for pet hair on carpet. All in all we are happy with it. It has some good things and some bad.The good. It cleans up pet hair on carpet very well. We run it daily for our living room and master bedroom. It does a great job cleaning those areas. It even gets under the bed!  Once a week we put it in the kitchen and let it do it¡¯s thing in there. Over all it¡¯s pretty quite. You can watch tv when it¡¯s running.The bad. It¡¯s a bit of high maintenance. The bin needs dumped manually daily. The rollers need to have the pet hair cut off then about every 2-3 days. It does not map out your home, like some more expensive ones do. In return it will sometimes vacuum the same spot/areas multiple times. The battery life is very short. It last about an hour. If it mapped the house out and had a memory it could probably get the house done everyday. But since it doesn¡¯t we found that it can get the living room and master room done in one cycle. So be block off the other rooms. It does have trouble going from the transition from tile to carpet. It will get stuck. That¡¯s why we have to do the kitchen separate. We ended up buying a couple lasers to keep it out of certain areas. It some times get stuck on behind things or corners. It¡¯ll just sit there and the battery will die until we get home and put it back on the charger.  We still have to use the big vacuum once a week. But boy what a difference this little girl makes for pet/dust allergies.So it works and does a good job. You have to play around with it and see where it can and can¡¯t go, so it doesn¡¯t get stuck. Buy the lasers!!  We like coming home to clean carpets everyday!!  It¡¯s not perfect and needs some quick daily attention. But it is one of the less expensive models out there.  I haven¡¯t been able to get the cat to ride it. But he has figured out how to trap it under the rocking chair.I¡¯d recommend this model if your looking for something that gets the job done and don¡¯t mind cleaning it out daily.

  This has been a lifesaver! It may not run in a straight line but it cleans up rather well after my two dogs and two kids. I would say it is best used for in between major house cleanings. Unfortunately the bin is very small so needs emptying daily and unless you have a way to block it into one designated area it gets distracted lol. would love the tower but I don't like the battery option rather be able to plug them in.

  It's nice to let somebody else do the sweeping around the house. After about an hour or so, the little guy has usually got the place looking spotless. That said, if you plan to be in the same room where the Roomba is cleaning, it's gonna be agony to watch it roving around bumping into things and skirting right past the exact same crumbs 6 times in a row.In a way, it feels like I'm just buying the very first prototype of a new technology. In 10-15 years, we'll probably have some newer version of the Roomba that will make this thing look like a screw-driver. But I'm glad to be supporting the technology in its early days.

I love ability to schedule cleaning times, and remotely start/end cleanings via my phone. Setup was easy and intuitive! And I am quite impressed with the cleaning. I have 3 cats, and a large, long haired dog. While this does not Completely replace my need to vacuum, I am now vacuuming once per week instead of every other day! Despite many cords, rugs, transitions from hardwood to carpet, and my tons of furniture, it has yet to get stuck. Cleans for about an hour and a half each day, and then returns to the charger. I cannot speak to the longevity yet, but if I have issues any time soon, I¡¯ll be sure to update my review.

When we first started it up, I was amazed at the hair and dust that it picked up...after 4 weeks of work, it is just now to the point where I don't have to empty or doo extensive work on it every day to remove the massive amount of hair that it has found. We fired the ""maids.""

  For a last minute big Xmas gift for the grandparents this was a home run.Pros-yes, they will love watching it go around the house and actually pick up debris from carpet to tile and room to room.-yes, Alexa is able to offer a command to have ¡°Elvis¡± start vacuuming and stop vacuuming.-yes, it is able to go 3 rooms over and eventually find itself back to the dock.Cons-Amazon tablet does not power roomba app. Had to connect to her smartphone to sync with Alexa. (Assume iPad will have iRobot app)-600 version does not have mapping technology. I originally called Best Buy and knew this going in but... If you want a robot that looks like it knows what it is doing (Ex. Not just hitting spots more than twice (I would think), May be best to go with one that  was more expensive.Thoughts:-after purchasing this for grandparents, I will be on lookout for cheaper upgrade price with mapping technologies for myself or parents.Thank you roomba!

  I really tried to love this thing because I¡¯ve wanted one for sometime now but it is SO loud on anything but carpet! It aimlessly wanders about missing spots.

  I absolutely LOVE this machine! It is way more than I expected. I have only had it for 24 hours, but don't know what I did without it! I have a golden retriever puppy who really just started shedding about a month ago. She is my second golden so I knew it was coming!  I have been running my iRobot (Max) for nearly every waking moment to ""catch up"" on this puppy's shedding.  It runs like a beast! It hasn't gotten stuck anywhere. It even went under my sofa and sucked up who-knows-what under there! I was concerned a bit, but it just popped out the other side of the sofa. SO PLEASED WITH THIS PURCHASE!  No jamming up, no getting stuck in small spaces, just easy, relatively quiet and a BEAST of a machine!

  We have four dogs and don't always get around to vacuuming. This has been a nice addition to just set the schedule to run once a day and let it go. Although the bin isn't overly huge, the machine does a great job of picking up the hair to where we don't have to clean with the big vacuum as often.

  There are a lot of similar choices now that the patent expired, but after very careful consideration I chose a Roomba. Why? First, it was on sale for $199. But other than that, my  thinking is that other, newer manufacturers simply cannot beat the experience iRobot has amassed since they invented these things long ago. All the little bits and pieces of feedback they received over the years I believe has made the Roomba machine a solid choice. For example, I was reading reviews for another brand that made clear a common failure was the rubber seal around the filter kept breaking and people had to spend another $9 or so to buy a replacment part, which the manufacturer happily sold you. I believe iRobot fixed all the little fails over the years and the result is a more reliable product. I have owned 3 previous Roombas and I watched each model add little features that addressed preformance and reliability issues.  The fact this model looks only slightly changed from the last one I bought 9 years ago tells me they have perfected it. With other manufacturers, they are still in the learning process and you are the Guinea Pig. Also, I have always received good, if not excellent, customer service from iRobot, which may not be the case, according to customer reviews, with some of the newer manufactuers.  Obviously, the lower prices of newer brands is tempting, and you could say having to spend extra for replacement parts still costs less than a Roomba, and you don't mind the downtime, and the difficulties dealing with their customer service. But, I buy vacuum robots for the convenience and I place a value on reliability and customer service , so I chose to go with the brand I have always had a good experience with and it's worth it to me.

  The product is very good. The set up was very simple and quick. The app (which is used to control) is good as well. There is no problem at all as such with the product...... but if you have a large room (or set of rooms) it doesn't reach where it needs attention. It may not go to the particular spot which needs attention for 30-40 minutes...or it may not even reach there at all unless you manually take it there. Then it misses the point of cleaning entirely in my opinion.  It is good cleaning machine when everything is kind of ""okay clean"" in the first place or just as a weekly cleaning with a  a cool robotic cleaning machine that can be controlled by app.

  The Roomba does not go over the whole house. It just moves around randomly and often gets stuck on a ¡°cliff¡± but it will actually be a basic kitchen rug. The areas it does go over are well picked up as long as you clean the filter every week.

  If your whole house is hardwood and tile than I could see this Roomba as being extremely helpful. My biggest issue, and a big one for me, is that it cannot make it onto my carpets on it's own. It seems to think that it's hitting a wall or something. When placed into the carpet, half the time it gets stuck, and it's not especially long carpet by any means, and it also has no problem rolling straight off of the carpet and then, again, it's not able to get back into the carpet. I returned it.

  Amazing!!! I have such a hard time keeping my floors clean with a busy schedule and this has been a lifesaver. It can do my whole 1100 square foot apartment without dying. I have had to take the brush out to remove the hair but it¡¯s honestly easier to do than with my normal vacuum. The best part about this is that it can be started fro the app even when I¡¯m not home. It has run over some cords and things but it hasn¡¯t damaged anything or even knocked anything over. Well worth the money!!

  Where has this been all my life? I have 3 cats and two dogs and its absolute carnage in my house on a daily basis. This little machine cleans while Im at work and does a pretty darn good job. It isnt the smartest vacuum as it likes to get caught on sheets, blankets, shoes, etc. But if you pick up prior to leaving it to its work it does fine. It requires emptying the bin after each use and if your house is particularly dirty perhaps once while in use but for regular maintenance, once is fine. For me, this is the best purchase Ive ever made.

  We have 2 dogs and 2 cats and it does a great job cleaning up.  we still run our trusty Dyson pet vac every now and again, but this will do a nice job on the carpets when we give it time.  the only drawback is the random bouncing around the room, the more expensive versions can track its own movement.  the only drawback is the the canister is kinda small for our needs with the animals, but it can do a complete cycle without having to empty it.  suction is good, it will pick up small legos and such, so you need to have things that that cleaned up before you run it.

  I love this roomba! Perfect for me I have long haired pets, so this really helps with keeping my carpet cat/dog hair free. BUT something to think about before you buy. If you have a pet that isn¡¯t house broken, or kids/pets that track in mud the roomba will run over the mess and spread it around. Not to mention that you¡¯ll have to also take the little guy apart to clean it. Also before you run the roomba do a quick check under furniture for small objects that can get stuck in the roomba. Other than that it¡¯s soooooo worth it I hardly ever have to vacuum any more. I just set up the cleaning schedule for the week  and empty the dust bin when I get home.

  I wavered on buying a robot vacuum for a long time, but finally caved and bought Minion. Even with the cons listed below, I would 100% recommend this Roomba to family and friends (which I already have)! Minion has saved me so much time, and I'm enjoying actually walking barefoot on my floors again.PROS:Easy to set up and use. I especially love the ""scheduled clean"" feature on the app! I've scheduled Minion to run while I am at work, so all I do the day of cleaning is move a few items like cat toys off the floor and then simply empty the dust bin when I get home.Cleans pretty thoroughly. Previously no mater how much I swept, my floor seemed to always be covered in cat litter, dirt, clumps of black kitty hair...Minion is great at getting about 98% of it, switching between my carpets and hardwood/tile with ease. (My apartment is mostly hardwood with a few large area rugs and tile in the kitchen.)Charge lasts a while. Minion is able to clean my entire 700-sq foot apartment (except for the bathroom) on one charge, about 1.5 hours.Doesn't scratch my hardwood floors.CONS:The Roomba is louder than I expected, especially on hardwood or tile. Because I live in an apartment building with thin walls, I only run Minion during the day.It's also a bit thicker/taller than I expected, but is still able to fit under most of my furniture (6 inches seems to be the lowest it can fit under).I get that the robot has to bump into things to get a sense of where it's at, but it bumps objects fairly roughly. You can expect your kitchen chairs, trashcans, etc. to move around. There's actually marks on the front of my Roomba from where it's bumped into the wall, etc.I had to buy a separate virtual wall to stop Minion from running into my cat's dishes. You WILL need one of these devices if you have a pet. It was very necessary and does its job, but it was a little annoying to have to buy a separate expensive accessory.It can take a few tries for the vacuum to dock itself. It'll run into the docking station and move it around. Also, I found out that if you physically pick up the Roomba during a cleaning cycle (say, to move it to another spot), it won't be able to dock itself. Just fyi. Now, I just leave Minion to do its thing and dock itself whenever it finishes.All that being said, I love how much time Minion has saved me, and coming home to clean floors every day with so little effort. For those reasons alone, worth every penny!

  We just received our new Roomba 675 via Prime a few days ago and have used it twice. According to iRobot¡¯s website, this device should have come with an included cleaning tool, but it¡¯s nowhere to be found in the packaging (see my attached pic from iRobot¡¯s website).Anyhow, we have a very hairy puppy ( a 15-month-old Great Pyrenees) and this seemed to be the model to get for keeping his loose hair under control. Well, having used it twice in four days, I can say that it does a good job of getting our pup¡¯s hair off the floor, in fact, perhaps too good of a job. I¡¯ve run just two cleaning jobs with it and have already had to perform a thorough cleaning of the brushes, filter, sensors, charging contacts, etc., as the device was full of dog hair after just two cleaning jobs. Additionally, it got hung up a few times on rugs and cords during those two cleaning jobs and had to be manually repositioned in order to continue cleaning.On the second job, our Roomba 675 failed to automatically return to its home base and instead played a vocal track telling us to manually put it on its charger/base. The battery seemed not to be charging, so I performed the thorough cleaning that I mentioned above hoping that it might alleviate the non-charging issue. It now appears to be charging normally, so we¡¯ll see how it holds up. It¡¯s a cool little device, but the jury¡¯s still out for us.

Also, it acts like an individual with a highly severe case a.d.d. it goes one stripe across the living room then 2 minutes later it cant find its way out from under the kitchen table.

But after adding our Roomba ¡°lil Hoe¡± my floors are always clean. No more dust, no more grit. She even keeps up with the dark hair from my 125 pound Great Dane puppy. She is amazing. I have her set to run every day. I do need to clean out her dust bin, and clean her sensors and brush often, but my floors are amazing!

  Totally unworthy. Random cleaning is horrible and this robo is totally brainless. Bounces and damages the baseboard all over the home and gets stuck everytime under a couch or fridge doors. Doesnt clean all the areas and suction isnt impressive as well. If you want to have an exhibit item that will never use you can buy this crap.

  I got this on sale for $100 off. A bit louder then I expected, but still quieter then a regular vacuum. We have 3 cats and 2 dogs so pet hair is a constant battle, which roomba makes short work of between regular sweeping/vacumming. Gets trapped on occassion trying to vacuum the fan bases but cries out for help as well as sending a push notification if you have the app. All in all a great gift.

  This Roomba makes life so much easier. We have an anxiety ridden Shellie that sheds like crazy. My wife and I used to spend 2 hours sweeping and vacuuming every couple of days just to get rid of the dog hair but, this roomba takes care of everything with zero effort on our behalf. Very impressed.Prior to this we owned a fake roomba and it sucked, short battery life and poor suction but, this particular roomba delivers. Triple the battery life of the fake roomba and fabulous cleaning power and, the Shellie fur does not wrap around the spinner brush or clog the suction.Well done Roomba! 5 Stars!

  This Roomba has blown my mind! I have 2 dogs that shed like crazy. I have to sweep and vacuum twice daily. So I set up a daily schedule for Steve(yes he has a name) and then place him to spot clean once if needed. He does take a long time but I'm good with it because I'm not doing it. Lol. Steve does struggle with mirror finished furniture but to me that makes sense and he isn't damaging the furniture so no real issue there.To sum it up, this might be the best purchase I've ever made.

  When it comes to Robot Vacuums rumba is definitely one of the most reputable brands, what I can't quite figure out is why they still charge extra for a basic sensor in the front of the vacuum that would stop it from bumping against your furniture and getting stock pretty much on anything like chairs etc. My ""modern"" furniture was definitely not compatible with this model and as a result, the vacuum ended up scratched and would often get stuck. make sure your house has unobstructed floor/carpet otherwise check out another brand that has floor mapping or sensors to avoid it bumping into furniture or you'll be annoyed within a week.

  For the price, this Roomba is a great purchase. Given enough time, and the proper environment, it will adequately clean my floors. The gen 1 navigation software is the only thing that lets you down on this model. I have a reasonably open and clear living room, however, the gen 1 navigation will often spend a majority of its time in a single corner of the room. The Roomba will escape the corner briefly, making a single long straight pass into my main living space, then return to the corner it clearly loves. The most current job has been running for 45min, and 30 of those minutes have been spent in that very extremely well-swept corner. Perhaps it is because this corner gets the most sun. The robot just wants to work with the warm light glinting futuristically off its gleaming hull. Dreaming, perhaps longing, for the wide-open fields and rolling California hills just beyond the edge of the carpet. Looking to the skies and wishing to join its kind exploring the planets and stars, sucking up dust on a long and endless martian plateau. After about 90 minutes these dreams must end as its batteries run low. The Roomba will concede to its fate and return to the shadows under my bookshelf, seeking out its base station and shedding the burden of consciousness as it slips quietly into a deep and dreamless sleep.

  I¡¯m not a huge fan of using it on my hardwood floors only because it will often push stuff away as it goes by, eventually it will come back around and get it (usually). On my carpets I really enjoy using it! Cleans up so much dust and hair that you didn¡¯t even think was there! It could be better at detecting before it runs into things. It doesn¡¯t seem to have any rhyme or reason on where it cleans and how it detects when it has completed its job. Overall battery life is pretty decent. I have a 1600 sq ft house and I usually have to use it in two sessions but if I clean upstairs and then start it is usually close to finished when I¡¯m done cleaning downstairs and then I let it charge and then move it downstairs. It does great detecting not to fall down the stairs but sometimes will ramp over things like my sons baby swing legs and get stuck. The alerts are nice one my phone letting me know when it needs charged, is stuck, or needs my attention because it tries to suck up a stray sock. Over all I¡¯m satisfied. I use it about 3 times a week.

  it does a great job of picking up dirt! but it also is a pain in the ass because it gets stuck under bed frames, if it hits the edge of a shaggy rug, accumulates long hairs around the 3 prong brush and if not cleaned regularly it will stop the unit from working until cleared. sometimes has issues getting onto the docking station and lining up the contacts to charge properly. you have to clean the unit after every use. spend more and get the smarter ones, and also the one that empties the dirt out automatically, you'll thank yourself that you did

  I like the suction capability but this is not a smart vacuum. Without any type of guidance it really isn¡¯t worth the money. I would recommend buying one with laser or camera guidance. This vacuum misses so many spots, it¡¯s frustrating. It does a good job picking up debris on hard floors but at the same time it¡¯s so inefficient. Than when it¡¯s time to dock it takes around 10 minutes to find its home. Without the mapping feature it proves pointless to have. Also it gets stuck 8/10 times.

  I was super excited to get a roomba - no more sweeping the hard wood floors daily, due to visible animal hair!I can't tell you how many times this roomba gets stuck! Once it was caught up on the base of a floor fan. Always seems to get under the couch or recliner just right & not make it out.I'm constantly having to pull up ALL OF MY RUGS because it's either untwined it or folded it over with each pass.I think it's on the loud side as well!It runs for about 100 mins, but unfortunately doesn't pick up all the hair. I also noticed it goes back and forth over the same area SEVERAL times. I think, for 100 mins, it should really be able to do an awesome job on my entire house.We also noticed it's like we're spending more time remembering to pick things (electrical cords, rugs, shoes, etc) than being able to enjoy the automatic cleaner.I've gone back to using my Dyson on the carpet & Bona on my hard wood.Very disappointed :(

  I purchased a renewed one during the holidays for $179.34 before tax and I regret that decision now. At the time they had special pricing for $199.99 rather than the current $269.00 price. I¡¯m on my second one within 30 days and the second one isn¡¯t the same quality. This time they sent me a ¡®very good used¡¯ unit rather than another renewed unit. The first renewed one we received didn¡¯t detect walls or its surroundings very well and basically banged into everything. We joked around and referred to it as the aggressive Roomba in our house because it would literally climb up on items and our wall trim like a lunatic vacuum. As much as I tried to prevent it from climbing up on our shag area rug that it could not handle vacuuming (would get SO HOT & make a whirring noise), it would still sometimes knock over my folding up of the rug¡¯s edges and get on it! CRAZY...We currently have 3 robot vacuums in the house. One is a Bobsweep brand and it is far quieter and detects its surroundings very well. It is our favorite one in the house currently. Our second one is the Pure Clean brand for pet hair. It is smaller in size, but it works really well in smaller rooms (bathrooms) because it can get in between the toilet and the wall and the cabinet on the other side of the toilet.So... to the used replacement that I received today for the original renewed roomba... it is fairly loud, however it seems to detect its surroundings better and slows down rather than ramming into everything. But, it makes all these noises as it¡¯s making its decisions as to where to navigate. Also as it goes over long strides of our fairly larger open room it gets louder and louder as it¡¯s traveling across the hardwood floor? It seems to pick up cat hair and dust fairly well but these noises have me questioning its durability in comparison to purchasing a brand new one for 199.99 when I had the chance. Now I have a ¡®used, very good¡¯ rather than even a renewed one :(

  I would love to say I love this vacuum. I really like it and these are the reasons I don¡¯t love it.It takes forever to go back to the dick station to a point I have had to get up lots of times and finically bring it to its hub station.Idk if it is the app or the bit it¡¯s self but I am always getting errors or miss information. Example I send it to duck from the phone app and it work or I¡¯ll tell google to send it home and it would say it is already docked when in fact it is still running around.It could get loud if you want to have a peaceful evening tv moment how I usually use it at nights it is just too loud. If you are going about doing chores and kids playing around it shouldn¡¯t be an issue.Seems like it just goes around the house but not at any precise pattern In Which you can  say honestly that it cleaned everything.Some times it gets on my kitchen mat and cleans it and other times it seems to struggle.I wish it would clean my rug as well as usual vacuum do but it just gets stuck and gives me error.Overall I would still get it for simple daily cleaning but not if I¡¯m counting on that being the only cleaning method for my floor.

  Finally, I found the right robot vacuum for our needs.  We have two corgis ¡¦ enough said, hair everywhere.  We've tried two other robot vacuums and this one seems to do the job fantastically!!  Easy dust bin cleaning, moves around my house at a faster speed than the other ones and vacuums the heavy traffic areas thoroughly by going over it several times.  This is our first day of using it and the only thing I noticed was having to pick it up and place it in the hall after it vacuumed the living room about four times but had not gone down the hall and bed/bath rooms.  So far I really like it.  I only wished it had a remote as we have dumb phones, no smart phones to use the app.

  Looks, Works & cleans like the old roomba, which is a good thing.Problem is irobot replaced the onboard scheduling interface with a wireless interface requiring a app on your smartphone.This interface is not very good in terms of its reliability & the initial setup will fail very easily by not connecting to wifi. It also tends to easily loose its connection to wifi after you finally get the initial connection.Be prepared for a potential frustrating experience.Irobot should get the bugs out of wireless interface & also restore the onboard interface.

  Whether you get the expensive deep-cleaning type or the cheaper one such as this - you will be thrilled you did. As you can see from the picture <U+2013> I have a lot of hardwood floors and area rugs. The roomba (Rosey <U+2013> named after the housecleaner on the Jetsons) cleans really well. And because I have to pick up mild clutter stuff such as shoes, clothing on the floor, etc. (so she doesn't get caught up in them), my house is so much cleaner by default. People could stop by and I wouldn't be embarrassed (you know what I mean). However, I wouldn¡¯t want to have it run without me around. Sometimes it to need to be moved to other locations. It will shut down and request to be moved to a new cleaning spot because for some reason it gets stuck in a cleaning loop. But for me <U+2013> I don¡¯t care about that. I have a lot of things to do and don¡¯t have time to do the mild daily sweep/vacuum clean up and she does those daily jobs very well. Worth $199! Does an excellent job of picking up hair, dirt and other debris. My floors are nice and clean. Don't second guess it - just do it!

  I used a Roomba for about 3 weeks and sent it back. It is by no means a way to keep your house clean the way a manual vacuum does. It misses areas and the battery runs out before it finishes cleaning all areas. My carpet is a charcoal color and it wouldn¡¯t vacuum it at all. After researching this, it¡¯s a flaw in the computer that thinks my dark carpeting is a cliff. There are a couple ideas on YouTube to fix it but they are not an acceptable solution for me. It also bumped into my light colored wood trim and scuffed it up quite a bit. I would NOT recommend buying one. I am going back to my dyson.

  Love this!  Have had under a week and have already done 27 jobs on 4 different floors. We mainly have hardwood floors with area rugs, and tile in the kitchen and bathrooms.  It thoroughly cleaned all the different surfaces.  I could finally clean the area rugs that are under beds and have been collecting dust.  Before the only way to clean them was to move the entire bed and vacuum, so it rarely ever happened.  I have 2 young kids who drop plenty of crumbs and I can finally stop following them around with the dust buster.  I hooked it up to wifi and Alexa and set a schedule which has been fantastic and very easy to do.  It cleans during the day when we¡¯re gone or overnight.  It almost always finds its way back the the charging station.  It has gotten tangled up in cords a couple times but now I know to move them.  I wish I would have purchased years ago.  I 100% recommend.

  I had a Eufy robot before and it was a good vacuum, but couldn't get over the door thresholds so was pretty useless.  The Roomba gets over them easily (except for the bathroom entry, which is a 1"" marble threshold, so I have to put the Roomba in there and close the door for it to clean the bathroom).  It's gotten stuck a few times, but usually when it's gotten caught up in hanging cords, which I've learned to keep up and away from the floor.  Overall, the Roomba has done a good job and I love coming home from work to a clean place.  I have a smallish apartment (~650 SF), and the two-hour charge lasts just long enough to get all the rooms (except aforementioned bathroom).

  You have to prepare the area for it to be cleaned, it has no floor plan disgn that may guide him but if you remove all obstacles and leave him running for a while the Robot will be pretty efficient. Corners are not his specialty and chairs cuase distractions that he leaves to other areas and that may cuase a repeated course over and over. My case I moved the chairs and then he cleaned very well

  This is my new favorite thing! I have a large home daycare, 3 kids of my own and hardwood floors throughout my house with carpeted bedrooms. I don't like to sweep and although my house was picked up and tidy, it often felt dirty. I've had the irobot for 3 weeks now. I run it almost daily and my floors are so clean. I don't even have to mop as often and there is less dust because it cleans under my couches, furniture and beds. It is amazing! My house is a 4 bedroom with a living room and den so I run it for an hour and a half in one half of the house, let it charge, then run it in the other half of the house. I clean out the collected dirt tray everyday because I don't want it to be full. Once a week or as needed I clean out the brushes and parts that build up hair. My daughters and I have long hair so it doesn't bother me to clean the brushes. I am reminded of all the hair I didn't have to sweep up. People think it is pricey but the time it is freeing up in my life is worth the price. I really don't have many complaints. I'm telling all my family and friends to get one.I can control it through my phone and my Alexa. It goes over my area rugs and from hardwood to carpet with no problems. It doesn't suck up curtains or bed skirts and if it happens to snag something it stops and I am alerted. All the things that I thought could go wrong are not a problem. It's a really great product for me and my home.

The rollers are cheap and don't work well and the little spinning arm that gets stuff out of the corners only spins occasionally when it feels like it.

  I have an ilife v5s and it worked great until after a year or so one of the wheels stopped turning. So I bought this roomba because I saw online that I can get new wheels from Roomba and replace them pretty easily. We have an old house with a lot of dust, so I figure it'll happen to the Roomba eventually also.The problem is that this one is taller than the ilife and the little camera nub on top keeps it from going under cabinets and things. It doesn't fit under the cabinet overhang in the kitchen, so it gets stuck under them, it doesn't even try to go under the vanity in the bathroom, it gets stuck trying to go under the entertainment center also.It also doesn't seem to pull up as much dirt and dust as the ilife.It isn't as good at docking either because the dock weighs less and it just pushes the dock around.

  We use this basically just to sweep up the luxury vinyl flooring on our first floor. It helps so my wife doesn't have to sweep every day like she was. Got it on Black Friday. It gets stuck under a sofa or in a corner sometimes but not every time. It's easy to pick it up and place it in another area if stuck. I am pretty happy with battery life around an hour. I did not know it would get all scratched up on top from going under things. That's a let down. To get mapping and greater precision you have to spend several hundred dollars more. This is good for sweeping. I doubt it would be that good for carpet. Easy to empty tray with all the dog hair in it. We like it. It is also pretty loud even though it only sweeps and does not actually have any suction.

  In concept this thing is great. However, the reality is the vacuum is a rolling disaster. My wife and I spend more time picking stuff up so the thing has a four line highway to move about the house then actually just vacuuming the floor ourselves. The dock sensor is trash at best, I ended up trying to grout the base to the floor because the robot kept knocking the station over then GETTING STUCK on the GD base!?!? We ended up just charging it up and sending it to ¡°clean¡± so the dogs have a $200 play toy. But as a dog sitter this thing is awesome. The wife and I can send the robot ¡°to clean¡± on the trusty app leave the house for a nice meal and come back to a exercised pet and couple of lamps turned over. It¡¯s a good compromise. At the end of the by a Dyson handheld and leave the Romba to those folks who have no furniture, pets, interior walls, appliances, or anything else to obstruct the vacuum from ¡°cleaning¡±.

  Aside from an investment of $200 for a vacuum, this model is stupid.  There's no other word I can give it.  Some of the negative review are spot on.Note that I bought this unit from Target over Christmas break.Pros:Free vacuum cleaning laborWorks with a consistent schedule (never guaranteed job satisfaction)Cons:It loves to get stuck all the time!  Trapped under the couch, ottoman, fridge, shoe rack, and even coffee tables.  I come home and I find it stuck, the job's never done.  You need to free it for it to continue the job but I'm already away from home.It is straight up dumb.  Doesn't clean in a straight pattern and often goes to the same spot numerous times.  Think of a random pattern just everywhere.  It'll miss spots.It loves to get lost between an already opened door and the wall.  How does it happens?  It wedges itself between the fully opened door and wall.  It then tries to find it's way out.  Sadly, the door closes in on the unit and it is forever stuck in one spot.If you're going to spend money on a robot vacuum cleaner, splurge on the ones with a laser or IR detection.  Also, double check that it runs in a straight pattern to maximize it's battery usage.  The Roomba 675 often run out of battery while aimlessly wandering your house to go and recharge when the battery is low.

  GO TO VACUUM WARS ON YOUTUBE FOR IN DEPTH REVIEWS:A robot vacuum is only as good as the person and place it is being used. I bought one after much research because I wanted one that was cheap, but would clean German Shepherd hair and Cat Litter off of hard wood floors. I would love to afford a $1400 model or even a $500 competitor model with LIDAR guidance. $200 is what I picked up this model for.I let the roomba clean one room at a time. After each room, I clean it out. I remove all the hair and debris that I can. The newer, smarter roombas, also had a brush redesign. They use two rubber brushes. The model here and the one I got has one rubber brush and one bristle brush.The dog hair is picked up very well and gets everywhere. In the brushes, the wheels , etc. I was not bothered by this. It is easy to remove. I take the dog brush I got, brush the bristle brush, and the hair comes right off. Roomba makes a tool but any pet hair brush does the same thing.I live in a dusty area as well. It is amazing how much dirt and debris the Roomba picks up, that you can't see. I've been more than thrilled. You may have to do some slight cleaning around the edges of the room if you are a super clean freak. I've never let the Roomba run until it has run out of battery. It goes to the dock automatically before it does. Or it is suppose to.I was happy how easily it navigated over wires. I prefer to pickup all wires or block off areas to them. I block access to other rooms with trash cans or chairs. Doesn't need a heavy object. If the roomba touches something it turns around. No need to buy the virtual barriers.If you're expecting to buy this, drop it in your nasty house, and work miracles... it won't happen. You need to do some prep work and then the Roomba will maintain it with regular use.

  We named her Rosey.  Definitely a female robot.  Does not go any direction using a logical path.  Just when you think you've figured her out, she changes her mind and does something different.  She sometimes finds a spot that you wouldn't think needs run over a dozen times - and goes at that one area a dozen times, leaving other areas as yet untouched.  With that said you have to trust her.  She will get to 99% of the floors eventually, just some areas more than others.She hauls butt too.  You'd think she thinks company is coming and this vacuuming needs done NOW!  Low profile means she will get under most furniture and tables.  Edge cleaning is amazing.  Rosey does all this with minimum noise.  We can watch TV while she runs amok through our 6 room main floor.I think Rosey grew up on the East Side as she does not have a delicate manner.  She will run head on into whatever is in her way.  I can see where a vase on an end table would be knocked to the floor.  Not a problem for us, but you may want to pretend a toddler is on the loose in your house before you let her loose.Rosey does seem to get herself out of jams okay.  In a month of cleaning we only had to rescue her once when she got hung up on a power cord that I should have secured away anyway.  Most rugs on a hardwood floor are handled okay.  We had an issue with one area rug that Rosey would bunch up because it slid on the floor too easily.Dog hair is gone.  Great on that.  Easy to clean, and all rollers, etc are easy to clean when needed.  All I can tell you about battery life is that ours exceeds 90 minutes and still has half a charge.  When done Rosey goes home for a recharge without a hitch.Easy to set up and control with or without the app.Ready for one that does the dishes.

  I have great difficulty getting this vacuum to charge. I have no difficulty charging my phone. The difference between the two? A plug. I never have to worry about repositioning my phone or the charging sensors getting dirty. Why? Because I can just plug it in. I never have to worry whether my phone is plugged in or not because I can see the plug enter the port. STOP NEEDLESSLY COMPLICATING SIMPLE PROCEDURES.

  This is the 4th Roomba I have owned and it will be the last. It did great for the first year. I took very good care of Moe (that¡¯s what the kids named him). Having owned Roombas previously, I learned that occasionally, you have to remove the bottom plate and clean out the pet hair that gets in all of the cracks and crevices. After taking good care of Moe for a year, he just stopped working. The brushes no longer spin. This happened on an older model we had, as well. It is a very good product concept, but just not well executed,  as the product has a short life span for such a high price.

  I bought a 1044 square foot condo in May (one floor). I also own a very messy cat who likes tossing kitty litter out of her box. I have tried a lot of things to contain the mess but nothing works. I figured I could buy this and it would be able to clean that mess up perhaps daily and it would help keep my floors clean. So I went ahead and purchased it.The first time I used it, it only cleaned the carpet in the living room running over the same spots again and again and again (which wasn't even that dirty, really). I let it go for about 15 minutes but had to stop because it was getting late and I didn't want to keep my downstairs neighbors up. Ah, yes, the sound. Let's discuss that.It is not quiet. It's quieter than a traditional vacuum, sure, but sometimes when the wheels are pointing a certain way on the hardwoods, tile or vinyl, it does make rolling noise that I'm sure my neighbors are hearing. Since it runs for a VERY LONG TIME (more on that later), even though it's not as loud as a traditional vacuum cleaner, it's super annoying anyway.I let Anastasia (they want you to name them on the app) clean again the next day, this time uninterrupted with free and reckless abandon. She cleaned for one hour and 16 minutes. The only ""prep"" work I did was to remove all cat toys from the floor. She did an OK job in living room and kitchen and dining areas, however, she knocked into my cat's water bowl twice, spilling water everywhere. Note to self: remove cat bowls before starting. She ran over cords  (I was worried about that but she did well--no damage), she ran into a boot tray with winter boots on it, knocking it about 2 feet away but she did not get stuck, much to her credit. Note to self: remove boot tray before starting. She also knocked door stops out of under doors and moved those over a couple of feet. Note to self: remove door stops before starting. She had trouble with dining room chairs, and going under the table. Note to self: pull the chairs out slightly to give her more room. Even though she was running for an hour and 16 minutes, she missed two rooms: one small bathroom and one bedroom. Not sure why. She got stuck under one dresser in a bedroom and could not extricate herself. She had to be manually removed (and it wasn't easy).I looked in her bin and it was pretty full, much to my shame and embarrassment. Wow. I didn't realize my house was that dirty. Thanks Anastasia!Next time I ran her (after removing the cat dishes, door stops, cat toys, and boot tray), she ran for about 59 minutes until out of sheer annoyance I stopped her manually because it was just too annoying to let her continue. I could barely hear my TV. I thought, people are probably running her when they aren't home. She went over the same spots over and over and over again. She did venture further into the rooms she had missed before, the bathroom and bedroom but she didn't do the entire bedroom. I read online that the more you use her, the better she will get. The jury is still out on that one.  She went under that same dresser she got stuck under previously, this time without issues. She extricated herself just fine.  Again, the bin was quite full and I even found an SD card in it! I panicked for a few minutes, wondering if SHE had an SD card in her which I knocked loose, then realizing, no, she must have sucked this up from the floor in a bedroom or something. Whew!The last time I ran her, she again ignored that second bedroom again. I picked her up by her handle, and placed her in that bedroom, where she happily cleaned for a little while but missed sections of it, then left, never to return. I noticed some white paint on her from my baseboards as well.Next time I ran her, she did over an hour. Again, the drill: pick up cat toys, pick up boot tray, pick up water bowl, pick up door stops, pull out dining room chairs, pull out stools from island. Ugh. That is when I wondered to myself, is this even worth it? Seriously? I thought about it and said well, if I was manually vacuuming, I would be taking the same precautions, right? I wouldn't be running over cat toys with it. I let her continue and manually stopped her after a little over an hour. This time her bin was not quite as full. Finally, my house is clean?!?!? So basically, I have not allowed her to run more than an hour while I'm home because it's just too annoying. However, I don't feel comfortable letting her rip while nobody is home in case she gets stuck or does damage.Anyway, now for the good and the bad:  The good is that she does a decent job picking up debris, food particles, cat food particles, kitty litter, dust bunnies and hair. She does a fine job of docking herself. She hasn't actually destroyed anything. That's it for the good.Now for the bad: you have to do a lot of prep work before running, she runs for over an hour which is annoying, she goes over the same spots over and over again and totally misses other spots, so there is constant babysitting involved, which negates the cleaning when you aren't home benefit. If you have to constantly prep your area, and babysit this thing, is it worth the money? I say no. It's not. It would be faster, easier and cheaper to just run a regular vacuum around the house. Oh, and my cat is absolutely terrified of her. There will be no cute You Tube videos uploaded of her ""riding"" Anastasia.

  Only had him a month and he has far exceeded my expectations.  I live in a dusty place and it really accumulates along the floor moldings (saltiel tile floor).  Talus (that's his name) does a great job of keeping the floor dust-free and that is really my biggest need.  There are a couple places he gets stuck, and when his front cliff sensors get dusty he will stop at the edge and call for help rather than turning away.  So he really does best if I am around to rescue him on the occasions he runs into trouble.  But it happens seldom enough that it is not a bother.  He won't pick up heavy stuff but that really isn't an issue for me.He doesn't have a problem with bathmats or door mats.My girlfriend, who is much neater than I am, raves about how clean the floor is now.I don't have a pet so can't say anything about pet hair.Time will tell how he holds up, but for now I am pleased.  And, to be honest, he is pretty entertaining.  I guess I am easily amused.

  It¡¯s not a bad machine but my boyfriend I have really long curly hair and it always gets stuck on the spinning brush. The biggest problem I¡¯m having though is that it¡¯s hard to charge. I¡¯ll send my roomba to the doc but a few seconds after it starts charging it stops. It will not charge unless I physically push it down on the doc. If the brush didn¡¯t get tangled in the hair and if it at least charged it probably wouldn¡¯t be so bad. /:

  This bot has been very helpful since I purchased it in mid-December. There are 4 humans, 2 dogs, and a cat in my home. The amount of loose hair, dirt and dander generated requires that I vacuum at least 2 rooms a day to avoid having to watch the 1 year old Rott find and eat dust bunnies made of his own detached fur and dander. Watching that will make you want to vomit up dinner, seriously. Factor in my aging and mobility issues, and the Roomba becomes less of a convenience, and more of a necessity that I didn't know I had.It requires a lot of maintenance, however:1. The battery connections have to be cleaned every other day to make sure charging takes place.2. The debris bin is exceptionally small, so it has to be dumped and the filter cleaned daily, and during the first week, you will probably want to empty it two or three times in a day.3. In large living areas, the vacuum's path becomes unpredictable, but once you get used to watching it maneuver around table legs and crumpled up rugs, you can adjust it's route by lightly nudging it with your toes. It doesn't do so well without guidance in the den and living areas, but if you just leave it to run and sit and watch a film, it can do most of the job on it's own without support.4. It's noisy, and it takes longer than it should, because it bounces about aimlessly.5. The recommended maintenance schedule is ridiculous. Even the wheels have to be replaced periodically! Had I known I would have to buy so much plastic waste just for upkeep of the device, I may have skipped it altogether.All the negatives aside, it does help in a big way. It is an impressive piece of tech, and I expect future generations of Roombas will minimize all the aforementioned drawbacks. In the meantime, this one will do just fine.

  Never had a robotic vacuum before so I don't know what to expect.  We wanted a quick and effortless means for picking up after our yellow lab and this, it does well.  I can't understand the directional algorithms but given 90 minutes, it will more or less clean our 2200 sq. ft. house.  WiFi app is good for nothing more than turning on and off and checking on remaining battery level.  It you tell the Roomba to return to base, it usually can't find the base.  Great Black Friday deal!

  This robot uses fairly dumb bump and turn navigation. As a result, it misses spots and frequently can't find the charging base before the battery is exhausted.It works OK but it's not the Jetsonian godsend it's cracked up to be. I regret purchasing this model a bit. I should have bought a more expensive model, which actually maps your house and remembers which rooms it's done. But those models are 2-3 times more expensive.I can't complain too much for the price point but it's not really a great robot. When it comes time to replace it, I'll be mote careful about the type of intelligence the robot has.

  It's pretty good. It doesn't take the place of a real vaccum but it gets me through the week. It kind of just does what it wants. It will vaccum all rooms sometimes and other times not.

It's far from perfect but is helpful when ran daily.

  Here's what I like about the Roomba.  It cleaned surface materials pretty well, including wood and carpet floors. It worked itself around most obstacles (but it did get frequently stuck). I liked the app to control it. Cleaning was easy and straightforward.Unfortunately, there were a number of issues.  It cleans randomly; it's not smart and it doesn't map. So it can spend a lot of time in one small area. The battery life is only 1-2h at most, and it could only clean part of the lower floor before needing a recharge. It got stuck frequently; wires, loose fabric, certain corners, under a table. And most baffling, the machine rarely found it's way back to the home base as advertised. Even when I put it in front of the base, it would sometimes head in the other direction.Now I understand this one of the cheapest Roombas, yet I did expect it do what it claimed, and it didn't work for me, so I'll be returning it. Perhaps I'd do better with a more expensive smart model. All in all, a great idea, but disappointing execution.

  I have had issues with this vacuum from day 1. I waited like a month to even hook it up since we were busy. BAD mistake as i thought amazon would cover it like everything else to be returned, NOPE. You only have 30 days. So we have a robot vacuum that wont ever return to its base and the battery always dies while searching for home base. they said bc this one doesn't have a memory on it so it just randomly searches for home base. My home is 1,000 sq foot and it can't even clean it.

  The parts need to be replaced very often to get good results. I received mine on christmas, its now january 17th and it goes right over pet hair and dirt ( not a lot either) and doesnt pic it up. I replaced the filter and empty it once a day and its not picking anything up. Upon further inspection I saw that the brushes are all very worn so they all need replacing because they arent reaching the floor. Cheap parts i guess. I wouldnt buy it again if I knew the parts would have to be replaced every 3 weeks.

  Best purchase I made in 2019. I have a medium dog who sheds like a pound of hair a day. I have 4 foot long hair myself and i shed another pount a day. Foot traffic dirt for 3-6 people and my floor looks pretty darn spiffy considering i never have a moment to sweep myself cause i work, he works and we also have a 4 yr old. At first id empty it like 3-5 times in a run but now it is 1 or 2 depending if im home while it runs. It works great with our multi shade gray laminate flooring. Light to dark gray spectrum no issues. A few charcoal black entry rugs. About 1400 sq feet of cleaning to do and it does pretty well with 1 or 2 routes a day. Only gets hung up once in a while on the bottoms of recliners cause it is aggressive trying to clean up under the chairs lol. Also the occasional sock gets stuck in it. VERY EASY cleaning, just pull apart and put back together super simple. As long as you make sure there's nothing for it to get hung up under or loose cord/rope/fabric it runs continuously and works wonderfully. Also watch out for dog dishes lol it attacks them like crazy. Goes over door jams just fine, cleans on tile. It is probably 1/3 the volume of a classic vac. You can have an easy conversation and it is not a disruption.  Does well on corners. Oh and my toddler and dog find it super fascinating so plus!!!

  The Roomba 675 is a great product for keeping your home clean while you¡¯re away at work or just away for the day. I have a dog and a cat so I was skeptical that it would successfully pick up all the hair on our wooden floors and partial carpet, but I now stand by this product and would recommend it to anyone who likes a clean home. Especially if you have pets at home. The run time for my town house is about 2 hours of active cleaning. Great product and again would recommend.

  I thought it would be good to have it do the kitchen often.  We have tile floors.  It resides in the dining room.  It has a hard time running straight and therefore turns here, there and everywhere rather than just clean an area.  If I tell it to dock, it isn't a straight path.  But it does work.  Easy to empty and kinda fun.  I just wish it would go straight, turn around and go straight again.

  <U+00A0>I got this as a Christmas gift for my wife, and she was ecstatic about it! Sadly though, our excitement seemed to end there. I wanted to use it for at least two weeks before we left a review, so I could give a qualitative review. Three weeks into using it we found quite a few problems with the Roomba 675, and what was even more disappointing is how customer service was over the phone.1. The iRobot Roomba 675 claims it can transition from hard flooring to carpet/rug with ease due to its auto-adjusting cleaning heads and +Power boost technology. Sadly, this is not true. We have two rugs that are relatively short in fiber hight, and the Roomba 675 rarely gets onto them. At first, I thought that maybe we got a defective unit that just struggled to get over rugs and onto the carpet. After calling customer service, I was told that my carpet is over 1.6cm or 5/8in and that it cannot get over that height. After measuring my carpet, I found that my carpet is just under 1.6cm, which is supposedly within the hight limit. However, customer support concluded that I was wrong, and had no help or advice to offer me.2. The Roomba 675 claims that it has intelligent navigation. If you can call it running into walls and obstacles, then randomly changing directions intelligent navigation, then sure, its got it. Supposedly this also helps it ""navigate under and around objects and under furniture"", yet it CONSTANTLY gets stuck, under our fridge, under our couches, under our coffee table, and when it manages to get onto our rug.3. This unit was not made to last, which is why they sell replacement parts. We've been using the Roomba 675 for about three weeks now, and already the edge sweeping brush has broken. Sure, this is an easy fix and can be replaced for about $20, but that seems unreasonable to replace that often.4. The Roomba 675 claims that it automatically docs and recharges itself. Sadly, we've rarely seen this happen. If the Roomba 675 isn't within direct sight of its docking station, then it CANNOT find it. You'd think it'd use that ""intelligent navigation"" to remember where it has been and how to get back to its docking station, but it doesn't. From what I've noticed, it aimlessly vacumes and bumps into things, when its battery gets low, it seems like it searches for its dock, but usually cannot find it.5. Ultimately, we found that it can't clean deep or well enough to replace our normal vacuum, so we will still be doing that every week.To finish, if it was my choice, I'd return the Roomba 675 in a heartbeat, especially since it can't hold up to what it claims. But, my wife claims it's not a bad broom replacer... so if you want to give up sweeping, its got that going for it.

  <U+00A0>We call her ""Tilley"".  I received Tilley on 12/24/19, so she's been part of our family for about 3 weeks.  I am very pleased with her!  What I feel is important to know about us is that we are a retired couple, and both of us have lower back issues.  Vacuuming is a definite no-no for both of us.  The only rooms where we have area rugs is bedroom.  Our living room, dining room and hallway (see video) are hardwood floors, and kitchen is vinyl tile, and we have no wall-to-wall carpeting.I approached my purchase of Tilley feeling that, if she picked up 80% and I needed to sweep up the rest, I'd be very pleased.  I'm happy to say that this is truly the case.Tilley runs approximately 1.5 hours on one charge.Tilley DOES transition easily from solid floors to carpets.You can see in my video that she seems to ""wander"" around, ""willy-nilly"", not going in any pattern, and I was concerned about this at first.  But eventually she comes back around.Negatives:  As I mentioned, she DOES miss a few areas.  After all, the unit's shape is ROUND, so getting into corners may not be to the degree you would like.  So, if you're picky, you get out a broom and brush out what she missed.  To me, not a big negative.  Another point is that the cup that holds the dirt is small.  This should be obvious - the unit is not as large as a regular size vacuum!  Because we are home when she's going about her job, I usually let her run around for about 45 mins, then I empty her cup, replace it, and send her on her way again!  I find this is most necessary when she does the bedroom carpets.  In my bathrooms, I pick up the throw rugs before I let her loose.  Probably not necessary, but I just choose to take them outside and shake them.  Makes it easier for Tilley to get around in my small bathrooms.Connecting to WIFI was not possible - my iPad and iPhone are both older and will not update to IOS 11.  I'm home most of the time anyway, so I really didn't need that feature.This was probably the best Christmas present I ever bought for myself.  My floors are a lot cleaner than they've been in a long time!

  Got this as a gift for Christmas, so it's only run a handful of times as I don't run it everyday.It seems to vacuum up anything it finds, so it does a good job at what it's meant to do.My CONS are -1. It doesn't seem to have a pattern to it's cycles; it just aimlessly wanders around all over. It'll miss a clump of debris by inches and it proceeds to go into another room. Although it does find said debris later on most the time.2. It does horribly imo under large tables like a dining room table. It'll proceed to get ""stuck"" for 45 minutes under a table that has 10 chairs. It can fit between the chair legs fine, but it'll bump into them over and over and just proceed to turn ONLY right or left over and over. After 5 minutes under one chair it'll finally escape. In most cases if it learned better it would know it could have turned the OTHER way and it would be out from under said chair...3. It gets stuck in the weirdest places that it could get out of if it just tried a bit better. It gets stuck under my recliner by having one wheel run up one of the slanted legs under the recliner. If it would just try to backup more / turn etc it would easily get out. It does this almost everytime it runs now if I don't put a pillow under the recliner.My PROS are -1. It does really good actually going over our kitchen rug that has 3 inch long fringe (whatever it's called) on each end and hasn't got stuck on it yet.2. It does a good job at vacuuming. I have it set to run MON, WED, FRI and it always has debris in it. We have no pets and I like to think we're clean people, but it always seems to find something. I blame my kids...3. Spot cleaning is pretty nice. Just pick it up and put it where you want to spot clean and push the button. It'll go around and around in bigger circles over the area. In some cases it might be just faster to get your broom and dust pan though, but hey, technology! We don't need a primitive broom anymore!Overall, it gets the job done. Just don't watch it, because it'll drive you nuts on how stupid the device really is. If it used a learned pattern in each room it could finish the job in half the time and do a better job, but maybe they want you to buy the other bigger models to do that or maybe it'll eventually learn after a few months?

  Update4.15.20 now won't charge seems contacts having trouble making connection. I tried one of these when it first came out. I was very dissatisfied. Mainly the area they call the dust bin. So if you have pets , like a long hairy dog, you know what kind of hair they can shed. I really debated on a 500 dollar model of another brand I think shark that had a separate bin to empty into. First this thing is kinda noisy. You don't want it running while you home. I bought it this time because I got new wood floors. Got rid of carpet. If you have carpet don't buy this , so I swept first to help it out. So it comes on and drives around a few minutes . I thought I would test the dock feature. From ten feet away it could not find its way back. Also I started to buy another model with brushless rollers. After one vaccum I had to take this apart, remove brush which was totally clogged with dog hair. Had to take scissors and cut hair off the brush. Its designed just like a human hair brush, which is terrible for dog hair. Then there's the dust bin. Common sense tells you if the bin is small then you going to have trouble. Sure enough it was packed , so if you have a wad of dog hair about the size of your fist, that's it, that's all it holds . So basically if you start out with brand new floors and your pets live outside and never come in and this bot runs daily all day, then maybe it's ok, for real world situations it's not worth it . I recently after years bought a big upright vaccum with brushless rollers. Best thing I ever did. It think it was a shark, but mainly it's the rollers. If they have brissels like a human hair brush don't buy it.So I would spend the extra money and try for a robot with the rubber fins instead of brissels like a human hair brush unless you like getting scissors out all the time to cut hair off rollers. Then look for one with a bin to unload in. I did see I think a shark for 500 . This 675 is NOT  for pets and should not be advertised for pets, also there are several kits you can also get that that has extra roller brushes for this model, go ahead and order one or two you will be needing to replace the dollar very soon. Also look for one of these robots with brushless rollers, the kind it comes with has brissels like a human hair brush , I have to remove the brush every time I use it and take  sissors to cut out tangled hair . Look for a robot that has rubber fins instead of a bristel brush

  I love that I can have vacuumed floors everyday, with no effort on my part, especially because I have two budgies that are pretty messy.I have my doubts that the Roomba will last as long as my upright vacuum given that it¡¯s primarily made of plastic. I have the 675 and wish I could program it to vacuum rooms without it just bouncing around willy nilly.  Overall, I¡¯m glad I have it to help me out with my daily housecleaning maintenance.

  This model picked up a ton of dirt and lint.  I liked the fact that it vacuumed in places we normally can't get to with a regular vacuum -- under sofas, under beds, etc.  However, the randomness of the cleaning was frustrating.  I really needed it to clean heavily used areas of the house like the kitchen, but it kept gravitating towards the dining room which is currently unfurnished.  It also constantly got stuck on things like the track of sliding doors to the lanai or the lip of the walk in shower in the bathroom.  This made it impossible to use when no one was home, and when I did use it I had to rescue it every 10 minutes or so.  Our house is roughly 2,500 sf and there's no way it would ever clean even half the floor space with a 90 minute battery life.  And I refused to invest in additional accessories that would prevent the robot from going into areas that needed cleaning but would cause the vacuum to get stuck.  I returned it and ordered another brand with a reasonable price that has whole house mapping, a logical and efficient cleaning pattern, no go zones that can be set through the app without additional hardware, and can clean specific rooms.

  First off, I have a Aussie mix dog who sheds up a storm. I live in a place with no carpeting (see first sentence). However, I am in California with indoor/outdoor living 9 months out of the year, so dirt and sand get tracked in all the time. So, this little robot has been put to the test! The pros are: excellent cleaner, easy to use, sturdy design that is top-notch around legs of furniture and getting over door saddles into other rooms. Also gets under beds, sofas and rolls over wires and doesn't get caught up in them.The only negative is that it is noisy when operating. So I always program it to clean when I am gone, or turn it on just as I leave the house. You just have to plan and use it wisely, and this little bot is a very good investment. You will be pleased with the results. Highly recommend. I also got it on sale, so wait for just after a major holiday and they will usually discount it. Worth the money.

  First off let me say that I am not very good at this. I had read a review about this product and the lady was so impressed with it that I decided to purchase one for my wife. My wife told me that she would try it but that she would probably have me send it back. like the lady whose review I read we named ours Hazel. The lady did not have internet but we do. I also have a house full of Alexa. I have cancer and she helps me out a lot. She turns out lights and unlocks doors and now she controls Hazel. We of course had her since Christmas day. We had a crowd over for Christmas and we had a mess. Well we decided to try this new wonder we call Hazel out. So we unboxed her and plugged her into the wall and let her charge for 3 hours. My wife (who didn't want her) could not hardly wait to try her. (LOL) So the first thing we did was set her up in Alexa. It was very easy and of course Alexa needed a name for the unit and so that's why we choose Hazel. My wife ask me 3 times if it was time yet (LOL). Finally it was time and she was fully charged and ready to go. So my wife gave Alexa the command for Hazel to start cleaning and boy did she ever. The cat (who did not attempt to ride her) was quite cautious jumped up in the nearest chair and started hissing. Every time it came close to the chair the cat would hiss. LOL finally the cat got down from the chair and followed Hazel into every room. When Hazel turned around and headed towards the cat he would hiss and run. It was so funny. She drove the cat crazy for about an hour before returning to her docking station for a recharge. The sit in the hallway watching Hazel charge for an hour.  She got up things that we couldn't see under the sofa and the chairs. So now my wife uses Hazel on a regular basis. I think she likes Hazel more than me. Needless to say Hazel very quickly has become a part of the family for many years to come. She cleans very nicely and is really fun to watch. If you decide to purchase one of these I Robots beware of the older models that do not work with Alexa. The 675 is great with Alexa. Their are many models to choose from some more expensive and some cheaper but The 675 was a great deal and it worked with Alexa. I hope this helps you decide if you would like to own one of these fine robots.Thanks for reading and may God bless

  I don't regret getting a Roomba. It has it good and bad things. The good; it is a time saver and I don't have to worry about lugging my vacuum up the stairs (tri-level house). Letting it run for an hour or so gets about 98% of the cat litter spilled on to the floor and carpet.The Bad: I got the Stupid Roomba. Yes, in order to do the 98%, it's just all over the place and sometimes it stays in one spot, in the room, for, maybe 5 to 10 minutes just going in circles. And most times, it gets caught up on a ledge and shuts itself off. I have to come to the rescue and start it up again. Today was a good day. Stalled only once in the hour it was running.The first night I had it, I scheduled it to run at 2am. 15 minutes later, it stalled. The noise on my cell and her screaming, downstairs, woke me up and I had to get up and move it to another location in order to get it to run, again.  That happened twice before I put it back on it pad and went back to bed.I got this Roomba; it was on sale, only $249, I figured I could afford it at that price. After all the research I did, the Roomba I wanted was over $1100!! It was way smarter. The next few I checked on were priced at $400 and $600, both with smart A.I. Those are for another day...maybe.Oh well, I'm happy thought, I just can't schedule if to run overnight, I have to stand around and baby-sit it so it doesn't stall out on a ledge or on those string things at the end of the carpet.Besides, the cats are getting use to it, now. They will walk to their food, if and only if that thing is on the other side of the room.

  Bought the Roomba to replace my Neato because it got great reviews and was less expensive.  I have not been nearly as happy with it.  I do like that it connects to WiFi and I get an announcement via the app when a job has been completed or if he is stuck.  Many times I will come home from work and find him in the middle of the room rather than on the base.  He misses quite a bit, and even though I have a fairly small (2,400 sq ft) one-story home (and have three of the rooms closed off), he still doesn¡¯t clean the entire area.  My Neato followed a straight path in open areas, but the Roomba is random and the carpet tracks he leaves are every which way.  In reading over the cleaning log in the app, I realized there are more days he gets stuck or doesn¡¯t return to the base than he completes a cycle and returns for recharging.  He does not go back to the base, recharge, then finish; once he runs out of juice, he either stops right where he is Or returns to the base and stays there.  When I need to replace again, will go back to the Neato.  Guess you get what you pay for.

  Iroomba is a good concept but these lower end models have no proper programming, so it goes around randomly, misses lot of spots and goes over same spots too many times for no reason. there is no pattern or tracking of where it already vacuumed. So it wastes lot of electricity. Cannot recognize things on the floor, so it may suck up and get stuck with small items that are on the floor. The latest models seems to have a better organized pattern of cleaning and maybe better but are super expensive

  Brand new Roomba is better than my older 4 yr Roomba model. The advantage of this model was its price, it¡¯s WIFI features and simple design dust collectors over my old Roomba.  It collects more dusts with less air filter parts, easier to clean the collected garbage and it tells me if the unit is stuck over an obstacle via WIFI.  Again, my Roomba is cleaning hardwood floors and not a carpeted floor.  It does have a strong ability to push objects like shoes and slippers and suck up rubber bands, earrings and dental floss.  It best to clean the rollers every week to ensure nothing is jamming the rollers

  This one works great, don't get me wrong, but it collects sooo much debris it is ridiculous.  Where does it all come from???  One piece of advice regardless of the model...  prep your area before starting Roomba.  It can and will get stuck in odd places (corners, under table and chair legs, shaggy rugs, etc.).  Give it a chance to run wildly throughout the intended area without obstacles interrupting or confusing it.  In order to return to its cradle after about  90 or more minutes of continuous operation, it has to be in the path of the IR beam sent by the cradle in order to dock.  Otherwise, it will run out of battery somewhere in the house and stop.  It will send an SOS message to your cell though. One of them is funny when it gets stuck somewhere... Roomba needs your help at the edge of a cliff.

  We got this vacuum for keeping up on pet hair in our kitchen and front living room. The $200 price point made sense so we decided to give it a go. The only thing I dislike about this product is the randomness of its path. It still cleans the floor great but does over clean certain areas. This ultimately means it runs longer than it needs to and potentially misses areas.

  We have two mastiffs and two Roombas. Every day we have to empty them, and every day they are full. Although I have given up all hope of a truly clean floor for more than about 20 minutes (which is the time it takes for them to dry before I let the dogs back in) the Roombas tip the scale between sweeping twice a  day to sweeping every 2-3 days without the house becoming unlivable <U+0001F923>They are worth their weight in gold, or dog hair and dirt you don¡¯t have to sweep up yourself, which to me is the same thing.

  We recently had hardwood floors installed and suddenly started noticing all the litter and hair my wifes cats were trailing around the house.  You couldn't see it on the carpet so it never really bothered us.  I got this hoping it would help keep the floors cleaner so walking barefoot wouldn't be so annoying.  It does the job quite well, much better than I expected.  I'll admit it doesn't get 100% of the floor, probably about 95% but it's a big enough improvement my wife doesn't feel compelled to get out the broom.  It transitions over area rug and floor dividers quite easily too.  My wife named it Brad, so he does all our vacumning now.

  This little robot is worth every penny. It gets right up next to baseboards (where pet hair and dust accumulated on hardwood floors) and sucks it away. We even watched it pick up a poinsettia leaf that had fallen. Our first time, it got caught in a number of places but once freed, it just kept going. The first haul was a full catchment. Today I did the upstairs and it's spotless. We have 4 floors and it even senses stairs and doesn't fall. A great investment in a cleaner house with zero effort. Who wouldn't want that?

When the light catches the floor you can see the circles and tracks left behind it. Also the ¡°will auto dock after 90 minutes feature¡± is a lie. Never once has it auto docked after 90 minutes it will after 90 minutes continue cleaning then die somewhere in my unit forcing me to play the world¡¯s lamest game Of hide and seek because the battery is dead and I can¡¯t use the ¡°hit this button and the roomba will chime so you can locate it¡±.

  This was my first Roomba since my 6 year old 440 died in 2017.  I used a $99 Deebot N79 after my 440 died and was surprised by how much better it worked despite the price differential.  My N79 died after two years and I decided that if a cheapo Deebot worked so well Roomba's must have improved tremendously since the days of the 440.  I got the 675 and found a lot of features on this model that my Deebot N79 didn't have.Feature 1:  No remoteFeature 2:  Gets stuck under cabinets and tables.  The sensor on the front top doesn't so much sense as act as a leveraging tool to make sure you can't easily get the Roomba out from wherever it got stuck this time.Feature 3:  Doesn't pick up a lot of the debris that the Deebot does.Feature 4:  Premium price for discount performance.Feature 5:  Much louder than the Deebot.Feature 6:  Stops charging after 2 weeks of light use.Feature 7:  Gets stuck on thresholds and rug edges that the Deebot has no trouble traveling over.

  I'm glad I bought the Roomba but it is stupid. You put it in a room and sometimes it turns around and goes to another room. It will miss dirt that is right in front of it (I've placed it directly next to dirt and it's missed the dirt.) It often takes 15 minutes to dock even though it's in ""dock"" mode. You have to prep the house or it will try to mate with your cords and will knock down anything connected to a low hanging wire (e.g. a speaker, a corded telephone). It will leave a room and go back in a minute like a senile person who can't remember where he just was.Having said that it was worth getting because it goes under your couch and in your corners. If you prep, you can leave it alone. It gets a lot of dirt. It knows not to fall down the stairs.I like it, I don't love it, but I'm glad that I have the Roomba, as dumb as it is.

The cycles take about an hour and a half for three medium-sized rooms, which is about all the batter can do.

  Did not know when we purchased this for our son and daughter-in-law, that it operated randomly, not in a pattern.  So it misses spots and will miss picking up debris unless it happens to come back to that area where the little brush is on the correct side and will sweep up the debris.

  I was pretty on the fence about this purchase. We have three dogs and two cats and an older house with several rooms (as opposed to an open floor plan). I wasn't convinced that this little robot would be up to the task. I was wrong.This is one of the best modern devices I've purchased ever. Our floors have never been so clean. The first time I plugged it in, it randomly bounced from one edge to the next and seemed like there was no way it would actually get everywhere. But it runs for about 1 hr 45 min and remarkably manages to cover the entire first floor of our house (about 1200sf -- mostly wood, with a couple of rugs).A few caveats. One, I don't let it run unattended because it occasionally gets itself stuck somewhere and needs a little nudge. Two, I empty the tray out at least twice while it's operating. We run the Roomba daily, yet it's amazing how much dirt, dust, and hair it picks up. Makes me cringe when I think about our floors before! Finally, it's a little loud which makes it tempting to run when we're not home, but the trade-off is well worth a little extra noise. I wish we'd bought one years ago!

  This would be great as a hand held vacuum because it really does have great suction and cleans dirty very well.The problem is the ¡°room mapping¡± technology, which is basically just the thing bumping into walls and then turning in a random direction. It will go over the same spot 20 times while there¡¯s a pile of dirt 2 feet away and in those 20 times it will find a way to get stuck on something. So unless you have a square room with basically no furniture, you really need to babysit the thing and can¡¯t leave it alone. And it¡¯s not very quiet, so you might as well just vacuum yourself because it¡¯s gonna take 5x as long for it to bump into the places that need to get cleaned.

  Make sure to pick up cords, socks and other little things in the room you plan to vacuum before running this or it is guartanteed it will get stuck.The robot works excellent for what it is. The fact that it doesn¡¯t have any kind of intelligent mapping  of rooms mean it can miss areas, but if you let it run frequently, it doensnt seem to be an issue because it will get the other area on the next run.Overall, I love it. I haven¡¯t had to sweep my wood floor since I bought it, but I have had to vacuum my carpets, even though I didn¡¯t pick up as much as I normally would. My only regret is that I didn¡¯t spend more money on a smarter robot.

  This is a wonderful vacuum cleaner for your floors!  Do not waste your money on cheaper versions like I initially did!  I bought several cheaper cleaners that listed around $100.00 and they are JUNK!  There is no comparison to a Roomba.  This has great suction and a large roller brush that really gets the job done.  It is loud, but still not as loud as a standard vacuum cleaner.  It adjusts with ease from hardwood floors onto a carpeted room.  I love this thing and so happy I broke down and spent the money on it - Highly  recommend it!  It also docks itself to the charging port when its battery is low!

  <U+00A0>I'll get right into. I personally think the pathing algorithm is terrible. When it starts, it consistently ends up in the cleaning every room except for the room it starts in. It also seems to prefer smaller spaces, as it cleans my laundry room and the guest bathroom about 5-6 times every run and has a hard time covering large spaces as it tends to leave the larger areas before completing.Also, it's unable at docking itself (video included) It refuses to dock on its own and will repeat this process 5-6 times until you're fed up at watching it and dock it yourself.Lastly, it really just pushes a lot of dirt around then blows it away when it turns around with it's vacuum.

  First, the good--this has made my life so much easier, as it has pretty good suction and saves me time cleaning. It's supposed to return to the dock to charge when it's running low on battery power, but mine can't seem to find the dock, even if it's right beside it. And then it has problems docking properly, so even if you put it up against the docking station, it sometimes doesn't charge.

  We¡¯ve had this a few weeks now so here are some pros and cons we have discovered since using it consistentlyPROS: Generally gets the job done-it seems at first like it just goes randomly wherever with no pattern or method, but it actually cleans everywhere!  Perfect for dust, dirt, and pet hair  Quick and effortless to set up and use  Can be started with the app when you¡¯re away from home  Works with Google Home (¡°hey google, start the roomba¡±)  Easy to empty the binCONS: very loud operation  Takes a long time to clean the whole downstairs  Gets ¡°stuck¡± easily under the couch and under the dishwasher door (this is annoying because we usually start it when we leave and half an hour later, it notifies us through the app that it¡¯s stuck. Sometimes this can be resolved by simply clicking ¡°resume,¡± but other times, it¡¯s legitimately stuck on-or under-something)I do think it¡¯s worth it, and I assume the more expensive ones would operate more quietly and get stuck less frequently. But we usually let it clean when we are out of the house, so the noise isn¡¯t ever much of a problem.

  Always wanted one....could not really believe the great reviews...I mean HOW could it really clean so well?Well, it DOES!  It is seriously amazing!  The first time I used it, I stayed downstairs and watched it go all over in seemingly random patterns...and the result was dust-free marble tile and area rugs!!  The funny thing is, when Roomba cleans the floors, it inspires me to do the other cleaning things I might put off.  So it's a double win!  We took it upstairs then, and it was super at cleaningall areas including the carpet under our bed (where I tend to neglect).  So much dust gone now.  We are thinking of getting a second unit just for the 2nd floor.  Have not used the wireless-phone-connect app yet, but that's next.

  I loved my previous Roomba but it was used so much it was getting worn out.  This replacement has even better suction than the previous one and has wifi connection so the app tells me if it gets stuck or otherwise needs attention while out of sight.  If you don¡¯t like vacuuming then this will save you lots of effort and keep you out of trouble with your wife.  You will also be surprised at the amount of stuff this picks up if you have never had one before.

  What a piece of crap!!  The gears in my little brush broke 2 weeks after my return window closed (of course)  It also gives me a number 10 wheel error message on a FLAT floor.  Pay the extra money for a different brand!  The battery is not great either.  I wrote another review before giving it a 3...a 1 star is overrated.  One of my friends has this same machine and her brush doesn't work either...pfft!

  The first unit stopped running after about 20 minutes.  Not sure what the problem was, but Amazon sent a new one right out before we returned the old  Roomba.  This new unit works super!!  I am surprised how well it works.  We have found ""she"" (my wife named it ""Florence"") does work best if you lock her in a room and let her do her thing.  Otherwise, Roomba will wander all over the house until the battery dies which takes over an hour.  If ""she"" is more than about 20-30 feet from the dock when the battery gets low, it does not make it back to the dock for recharge.  Overall, it is a cool product!!

  We've been using this for a while now.  There are things we love about it (Alexa enabled, easy to use phone app, cleans certain areas really well) and there are things that are not so impressive (won't climb to clean a shaggy area rug, has difficulty returning to base, does not come with barriers).  We set it to go off daily at specific times which it does but will sometimes get stuck.  I am reading that these issues are common with most of these robot vacuums so I shouldn't be too critical, especially for the relatively reasonable price for a name brand compared to others.

  First off, I was very excited to get this Roomba. It's packaging was very nice and simple to un-pack. The setup looked easy but that's were the problem is if you have an auto switching WiFi router for 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz . The Roomba only operates on 2.4 GHz and you can't finish the setup if your phone is not on 2.4 GHz also. My issue is that my Orbi router is auto switching (it selects the fastest freq for the device it is talking to). This kind of router is now more common today. My iphone will only connect to my router at 5 GHz so I couldn't get past the setup even through the Roomba was talking to my network (could see it on my router command screen using 2.4 GHz). So, how did I learn all about this - 3 hours working with the Roomba tech support. Very nice people but they just have a bad product wifi config setup. I finally gave up when they wanted me to disconnect my satellite wifi station (in the attic), disconnect all my other devices, and reconfigure my router to only 2.4 GHz (hard coding) to get past the setup screen. No thanks - this experience cost be enough time and I didn't want to screw up my wifi setup. Sadly, had to return the Roomba. Now looking for a non-wifi competitor version.

It does a good job of working around/over cords, tassels on the rug, and gets around chair legs and out from under the couch just fine.

  I want to preface this with telling you that I own a mighty pet hair vacuum. I only got irobot for some maintenance cleaning every once in awhile. I stopped using it around 1.5 months ago when I realized it wasn't being effective. I just tried it again today, and I am so irritated by how terrible of a product this is that I felt the urge to write this review.Honestly, this product sucks (and not in a good way). I haven't even had it that long, and I just want to put it in the trash. There is a spining arm that stopped working very quickly. It gets stuck on all kinds of stuff and does repetitive motions, so it appears to clean the same part of the room over and over again. The hair gets caught up in the brush, I constantly clean out the brush, but it's not enough. Today, it appears to not even be actually sucking up anything. The little tray that holds dirt is literally empty and it's been running for 20 minutes. This is not worth the money. I want my money back. I tried to return it, but the return window closed. It's the worst. Don't buy it. Spend your money either on a way more expensive one or get a traditional vacuum.

  I have hardwood floors which I expected was the ideal surface for the Roomba. It cleans well enough, but almost never can dock without my intervention. It just pushed the flimsy, too light docking station  around, then get totally disoriented and wonders off to the opposite end of the room.Also, when I need ro interrupt a cleaning cycle and send the Roomba home to dock it is almost never able to find the dock.This product fails to meet my expectations in terms of its intelligence.  Nearly every cleaning cycle the Roomba needs manual intervention, which really limits its usefulness and defeats the purpose of having a robot do the work.

  I've had this Roomba model for a little over a week now and love it. It does a great job on our hardwood, tile, and low-pile rugs. Of course, this model doesn't do mapping of your floor plan, but I've noticed that it still hits most places every day. I also love that it self-docks. To help it focus on the higher-traffic areas (kitchen, dining room, living room), I close the doors to all the other rooms a couple of days a week so it stays in those high-traffic areas for its full cleaning time. Depending on your style of furniture and where cords are located, you might want to to also get some Command cord clips to clip your cords along the baseboards so they are out of the roomba's way. I would recommend being home the first couple of times it runs so you can see what areas might cause obstacles and problems and figure out solutions for those. Overall, it's a great product that does exactly what I wanted for the price I paid for it.

  I love this!! . I got it for a Christmas gift and wasn¡¯t sure it would work as good as it does.I have 2 dogs and it picks up the hair perfectly. (Short hair dogs)I have removed most all the rugs in my house due to potty training the puppy but have left all the door rugs. They are flat rugs and it rolls over them just fine. I did have to fold under the fringe on one of the rugs (honestly I didn¡¯t want to even try- i figured if my upright vacuum can¡¯t do it this little guy can¡¯t)It¡¯s a little louder than I expected but as long as it¡¯s running during the day and  not in the evenings when we watch our tv shows it¡¯s not an issue. It¡¯s fun to watch and I have found myself talking to it :)It¡¯s nice to be able to walk bare foot in the house and keep clean feet without any extra work :)Highly recommend! Super cool!

  We scheduled Roomba to vacuum once a week, Tuesday at 9:00 AM, when we had time to prepare.  We pick up loose rugs and secure inside doors so they cannot shut accidentally.  We came home once and found Roomba stuck in my study behind a closed door.  Another time it tried to ""eat"" a throw rug we forgot to pick up and got stuck.  It does a good job of cleansing except in small places where it cannot go.  Goes under beds, where we could not vacuum before, and got stuck against the wall one time.  Had to search for it and rescue it like a lost puppy.  It doesn't always dock itself when the battery gets low.  It is fun to watch (and dodge!) as it works through the house, over hard floors and carpet.  The app works well with it, monitoring its status even from afar.  Picks up a lot of dust, hair, etc.

  How did I ever live without this thing? It is a ravenous consumer of dog hair. It learns its way around. The ""Beep"" when it starts is like music. It gets along with my Jack Russell more or less  (He's still a little suspicious, though when it gets near his feeding dish.). It is easy to clean, although the bin might be larger. It's a tad noisy, but hell it's a vacuum cleaner and still quieter than the useless HEPA thing I used to push around. It goes under things mostly, although the dishwasher door trapped it once. Oh, and the phone ap and WiFi is flawless. I used water to clean the filter twice and it seems to be holding up. There. That's my report Mrs. Amazon.

  It's more than okay, if we see the price. It's pretty useful for most use cases, and the floor is pretty clean after using it. Sometimes, when there are many obstacles, it's harder for the robot to keep the floor 100% clean. Most of the times I tidy the room a bit before using it. Sometimes I find it hitting things too strongly, so I have to move fragile things to other place. Despite that, I really like having it

  Let me just say I am very happy with my purchase! This little vacuum has saved me a lot of cleaning time. I have three dogs and babysit dogs for a living so you can imagine the hair and dander I have all around my house. I have this little guy clean twice a day and can feel the difference on my feet and in my nose. It makes minimum noise and gets the entire room eventually, by that I mean it doesn't go in a straight line but within 20 minutes it will get half your house done. I would change it after every job and make sure to clean the brush so it will last longer and you get your moneys worth.

  I got this vacuum for Christmas 2019. I've had it just over a week now and so far, I absolutely love it! I've ran it almost every day since I got it and it definitely helps maintain the dirt and hair in my house. I have 4 dogs, 3 cats, a cockatiel, and 2 children. I was a little concerned that with as many animals that I have that it would be way too much for this little thing to handle. Boy was I wrong! This little thing keeps the hair too a minimum. Of course it doesn't pick up everything and yes, I have to empty it 2-3 times in the hour and forty minutes it runs each day, but it's really simple and I don't mind one bit. It keeps the dirt from the Nevada desert and hair from several animals to a minimum and I love it! Would definitely recommend to anyone who hates to sweep and vacuum but hates dirt and hair at the same time. You just have to empty it and keep it maintained which is simple. Again, I definitely recommend this vacuum!

  I do understand that this is an entry level bot vacuum, and that it does not have a mapping feature. I still feel the need to give it only two stars though, because it is not gentle when it runs into things. I have a couple of small glass top tables, one of which the Roomba knocked over. It also hits the legs on my couch so hard that you noticeably feel it while sitting down. Lastly, this vacuum seems to get lost in areas be hind chairs, and it just keeps playing ping-pong off the walls and chair legs until I came and rescued it.The vacuuming abilities are pretty decent, and the noise level is moderate for a bot vac. While I do believe this vacuum could be good in some situations, it does not belong in my house. We have since upgraded to the roborock s5 and could not be happier.

  Hubby and I picked up a Roomba for me for Christmas.  I honestly wish we had gotten one years ago.  I can't sweep daily or even every other day because the fibro won't let me, that is life.  I have 2 kids, 2 dogs and an oddly dirty cat, so not being able to sweep daily means no one keeps white socks white.  The Roomba means I don't have to get irked because the floor is grubby.  I don't have to hurt myself to do something one would expect an adult to be able to do.  I love that little thing, even if it does get ""trapped"" behind the Christmas tree I need to move to the shed once hubby has that ready.  It does a pretty good job and leaning over to clean out the dust try is a lot easier than leaning over with a dust pan for me.  I didn't get the newest or fanciest version so it is a bit loud but honestly no worse than kiddo playing Minecraft.  I also like that my youngest calls it ""Goomba"" like a Mario Brothers baddie.  I like the App for my phone because even if I cannot get out of bed, I can still get the floors clean.  We have all hard wood and tile, so I cannot speak to how it does on carpet.  Ok, it tried to sweep up the little rug in the bathroom, so either close those or pick up the rugs during cleaning.  It slides easily under my bed, under the futon in the living room, around the table in the kitchen and back to its home without problems.

  This little guy is a must! I have a 65 lb lab/pit dog and she NEVER stops shedding. I was using my regular vacuum at least once a day, as I can not stand dirty floors. This Roomba does an amazing job! I have a very expensive Miele vacuum, which I love, so I wasn¡¯t too excited to spend a lot on the Roomba. I can¡¯t see why, after having it for a few weeks, anyone would buy the more expensive ones. This 675 cleans my hardwoods and area rugs perfectly.Setting up the WiFi was a bit of a pain and though the app shows connected, I¡¯ve never been able to get my phone to run the Roomba, but that doesn¡¯t bother me. I just manually push the button.I have this little guy clean nearly every night. Before I go to bed, I do a walkthrough my house, picking up items that might compromise little Roomba¡¯s efforts. Lucky for me, my furniture is high enough off the ground so it¡¯s able to easily clean under my sofa and arm chairs.As someone else mentioned, DO NOT watch this thing in action. It will make you crazy watching the completely random pattern. That¡¯s why I run it at night. As a test, I did put a piece of string in a specific spot in my kitchen, the next morning, it was gone. Yay Roomba! The amount of ick in its little dirt compartment every morning is a testament to a job well done. (One time my husband asked if I¡¯d just mopped... nope, but little Roomba had cleaned in the night) I make sure to clean the bin every time (and remove the filter and bang it against the garbage can) it has cleaned, and about once a week I remove the brush and clean it as well.I¡¯ve now only used my Miele vacuum once since having this and that was after I took down my Christmas tree - there were needles all over the floor. ( I don¡¯t sweep with a broom, as I feel like the dirt would buildup in between my hardwood) I suppose that¡¯s the ONLY drawback to a Roomba... when you want immediate and specific results. I could have pushed the spot clean and it would have probably cleaned it, now that I think about it.To all of you clean freaks out there: this Roomba is better, WAY better, than sliced bread. Even if you don¡¯t eat glutton.

  My apartment is significantly cleaner now that this little guy cleans it on a schedule.

I found a cell phone charger in the middle of the living room the other day, which had been pulled out by the cord. Another time, he got stuck on a cliff. When I came home, he was sitting on a cell phone charging cord. Another time, he started cleaning, went straight into the bathroom, knocked a roll of toilet paper off the rack (it's a little rickety), proceeded to eat half of the roll, and then went home and went to sleep since he was full.Overall, a good purchase, and I'd do it again.

  With 3 cats and a dog, this is a must have for daily use. It keeps the pet fur under control between weekend cleanings and does a great job of getting under the couch and bed. As long as you remember to empty the bin between uses, it sucks up everything in it's path. It's not quiet, but much less noisy than a regular vacuum cleaner. I don't mind listening to it clean while I'm doing other things. It also does a good job of transitioning to surfaces of different materials and heights.

  Understand there's not really much ""robotic"" about this vacuum.  It just randomly ping-pongs around and if you have several rooms it may spend hours in one room never to touch another.  I had a Neato brand years ago that had lidar and would start at one end of the room and cross precisely over to the other side, make a perfect 180 and come back to vacuum the next strip.  The carpet looked like a freshly plowed farm field.  The Roomba will not do that.I'm not sure what the point of the wifi/phone interface is other than to set a schedule - it wont do anything more than that, plus stop the vacuum if you want it stopped.  The ""return to base"" has never worked for me.Now, all that said, it generally does what it's supposed to do.  If you sit and watch it, you'll be struck by how dumb it is.  If you just set it to start after you leave for work. you'll come back to find the dustbin full, so there is a point to it.  It won't supplant a regular vacuuming, but it will help keep your house clean.  Seems to work fine on hardwood floors and makes the transition to carpet just fine, where it seems to excel.  Good for going under beds, couches etc.  If I had to do it again, I would not pay for the wifi version as it doesn't seem to add anything.

  So far so good! Robot vacuuming is awesome.  You have to clean the brushes after every use or it doesn't work well (we have a lot of hair in our house!).  I highly recommend for the busy family that values free time.

  It has been great at keeping the floors swept, but we always have to cancel the cleaning cycle because it¡¯s hung up on furniture or a rug. Other than that my floors are definitely cleaner. I wish we would have bought one sooner.

  Buy it.Here's why:Cost/benefit analysis:How often do I want to vacuum?  about 2-3 times per week.  But I don't...Time: 1/2 hour x 2.5 x 52 = 75 hours.If your time is worth $3/hour, that's $225 in value.So, the thing pays for itself in the first year.  (I bought it on special at $200.It also has tons of non-monetary value.  of course.I actually only vacuum every 1-2 weeks.Now, I'm happier because I can ALWAYS walk around bare-foot with no dog hair around, no dirt or anything.That's awesome.I'm also happier because...I never like vacuuming.  How I have freed up timeIf I was vacuuming like ever 10 days, x 30 minutes-- I guess I vacuumed like 36.5 times per year x 30 minutes = 18 hours.OK...summary:Now I spend zero hours worried that i haven't vacuumed but I really should.I stopped spending 18 hours a year on something I hate.I spend 18 hours on things i like.I can walk around barefootThe place smells better.Ahh.....and this was a good purchase.-------------------------EDIT: Put towel under front or it won't charge.My Roomba wouldn't charge.  I think my floor is slightly uneven.I put a thin towel, folded, under the end that opposite the part that charges/connects to the charger.Lifted that side of roomba up just enough so the metal pieces made contact.Turned off schedule cleanings, all good.Every few days I pull the towl out and start it up.Easy enough to do.Plus, it doesn't get stuck or lost under the bed when I'm out, so I avoid that chaos.

  This vac does the job and I love that I don¡¯t have to worry about clean floors anymore. I use this on my hardwoods on the main level and as long as I use a wet mop every so often, my floors stay sparkling clean! I always thought I was a bit of a clean freak, but I was shocked at how much this vac picked up the first few days. I love how it gets under and behind the furniture where my normal vac can¡¯t reach.

  I've had this for a couple months. My husband got this for me and I wasn't 100% in. I have a small house and figured that it would be a waist of money for me. But I am amazed at how much it picks up. I love that it gets underneath my furniture and gets those dust bunnies. I have wood floors and carpets in the bedrooms. It has no problem going from floor to carpet. I just run it everyday while I'm doing dishes or laundry it is doing the vacuuming for me. Love it

  The 675 does not have a ¡° home¡± button...use the spot & dock, hold both down for 10 secs, the release, that reboots, then hold both down 2secs. Done, roomba will tell u are connected... this is a sweeping vacuum, not a sucking type. Let it keep cleaning, looks for dust with the sweeping arm, then turns. I¡¯ve watched mine, it¡¯s just looking for dust, at first , then gets deeper the more you use it..... it took awhile to go down my hallway, but veteran user told me to turn the hallway light on & it worked, darkness works against the sensors...who knew but vet....ha

  This vacuum, in my opinion, is not worth it if you're looking to use WiFi to operate it. I have WiFi 5G, and the Robot only uses WiFi 2.4 G. Who has that this day in age!?! This means I can not purchase the barriers that don't allow the Robot to have access to specific locations because my WiFi is higher then 2.4 G.  If you want that feature. You have to spend $999.00, which is absurd.

It is fun to use, though it's random cleaning pattern is like a spider on LSD making a web. It eventually does seem to clean all of my one level condo, with some caveats to note. First, Roomba-proof your house... get all mini blind cords, extension cords, loose items off of the floor. It will find them all without fail. Move chairs out from under tables so it can get around chair legs. You get the idea. It does find a surprising amount of dirt, even though it cleans every other day. One more toy in my arsenal for being a neat/clean freak.

  We had purchased the i7 vac and MP6 mop a month ago.  So impressed with the products and technology that I thought I would try a robot to clean my screened in porch of 600 sq ft. Did not need the higher tech mapping products, just the older style 'bump and run' type robot cleaning for this single room area. It is finished cement floor with 1/4 wide expansion/drainage joints.  Had several answered questions that indicated that this would not end well.  No idea what problems the others faced, but the 675 performed flawlessly.  No problem with scattered leaves or the joints in the concrete or working on concrete at all.  The 675 got this semi outdoor area remarkably clean.

  Son gave me this for Christmas. Little sweep brush mechanism stopped working after three uses.  Googled problem, which appears to be not uncommon.  You Tube guy showed why the problem exists and it comes down to cheapo plastic gear with little teeth that break off...hence no spinning of little cleaning brush.

  Why, why, why didn't I buy one of these sooner?? I am an animal lover and vacuumed nearly every day to keep up on the fur, dirt and litter. I always assumed this wouldn't work because my carpet is very high pile.I was wrong. I recently replaced my living room with wood floors so I thought it would be a good time to invest now that I had a space appropriate for it. But this little robot who could paid no mind and headed straight to the bedrooms (still carpeted) and did a fantastic job! I think he cleans better than my big vacuum.I run him twice a day and my house is cleaner than ever, all while I go about other tasks with the time I am saving. I'll be honest that he is a bit louder than I expected, but 3 of my 4 cats aren't scared of him, so he must not be that loud.I also think he can sense the cats because I swear he follows them around (and vice versa).So happy with my roomba purchase!
